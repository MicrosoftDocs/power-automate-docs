# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Requests for Microsoft Flow - Microsoft Accounts (MSA)

This article prepares you for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This article not only describes what Microsoft is doing to prepare for the GDPR, but also shares steps you can take today to support GDPR compliance when using Microsoft Flow.

## Prerequisites

Users can perform the actions outlined in this article for Microsoft Accounts. Additional information is available for Azure Active Directory accounts [here](gdpr-dsr-summary.md). 


A user needs to have an active Microsoft account with a [free Microsoft Flow license](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/pricing/). Users who do not meet these requirements, will be unable to perform the following actions.

## Responding to DSRs for Microsoft Flow customer data

The GDPR gives rights to people (known in the GDPR as data subjects) to manage the personal data that has been collected by an employer or other type of agency or organization (known as the data controller or just controller). Personal data is defined very broadly under the GDPR as any data that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The GDPR gives data subjects specific rights to their personal data; these rights include obtaining copies of personal data, requesting corrections to it, restricting the processing of it, deleting it, or receiving it in an electronic format so it can be moved to another controller. A formal request by a data subject to a controller to take an action on their personal data is called a Data Subject Rights (DSR) Request.

This article discusses how to use Microsoft's products, services and  tools to help find and act on personal data when responding to DSRs. Specifically, this article includes how to find, access, and act on personal data that reside in Microsoft's cloud. Here’s a quick overview of the processes outlined in this guide:

1. Discover: Use search and discovery tools to more easily find customer data that may be the subject of a DSR. Once potentially responsive documents are collected, you can perform one or more of the DSR actions described in the following steps to respond to the request. [Microsoft Flow DSR Discovery documentation for Microsoft Accounts](gdpr-dsr-discovery-msa.md)

1. Access: Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud and, if requested, make a copy of it that can be available to the data subject.

1. Rectify: Make changes or implement other requested actions on the personal data, where applicable.

1. Restrict: Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various online services or turning off the desired services where possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another location.
    
1. Delete: Permanently remove personal data that resides in Microsoft's cloud. Learn more about[ deleting personal data for Microsoft Accounts](gdpr-dsr-delete-msa.md). Learn more about [ closing a Microsoft Account](gdpr-dsr-accountclose-msa.md).

1. Export: Provide an electronic copy (in a machine-readable format) of personal data. [Learn more about exporting personal data for Microsoft Accounts](gdpr-dsr-export-msa.md).
