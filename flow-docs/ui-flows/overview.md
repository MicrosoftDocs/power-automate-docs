UI flows provides Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities to Power Automate. You can use UI flows to automate repetitive tasks in Windows and Web applications. UI flows records and plays back user interface actions (clicks, keyboard input, etc.) for applications that don't have easy-to-use or complete APIs available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - A preview feature may have limited availability and restricted functionality. A preview feature is available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

> [!IMPORTANT] UI flows is currently rolling out across regions. If you either don't see the feature, cannot create UI flows or have an error as you try to run it within a Flow, please retry later.

You can jump right in:

- [Create and test UI flows for desktop](create-desktop.md) 
- [Create and test UI flows for Web applications](create-web.md)  

### UI flows or API?

With Power Automate, you can automate both modern applications with APIs, or legacy applications with incomplete or missing APIs. You can even combine legacy apps, modern apps, and manual processes in a single automation.

| **Application type**      | **Power Automate feature** | **Benefits**     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Modern apps with APIs| Connectors                 | High reliability |
| Legacy apps (no APIs)          | UI Flow                    | Easy to create   |


You will find your UI flows alongside automated, button, scheduled, and business process flows in the **My flows** tab.

## Next steps
