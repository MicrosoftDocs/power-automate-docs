# Copilot in Power Automate

Copilot in Power Automate accelerates your journey to adopting automation and transforming your processes. It enhances these scenarios by using the instructions you give Copilot written in natural language to surface possible solutions that can achieve desired results. Copilot stays with you all the way during creation to guide you through your entire process.

Use the following sections to learn how to use Copilot features in Power Automate.

## Copilot in cloud flows

Copilot in cloud flows allows you to create automation that helps streamline your workflow through quick and easy natural language expressions. You can create a flow by describing what you need through multiple steps of conversation.

## Copilot in Process Mining

Copilot in Process Mining *ingestion* navigates you through the ingestion experience in Process Mining. Copilot in Process Mining process *analytics* helps you generate process insights through natural language. Copilot can then take the data you collected and easily summarize findings from it quantitatively and qualitatively.

## Copilot in desktop flows

Copilot in desktop flows allows you to analyze desktop flow activity. With this analysis, you can democratize access to insights by asking Copilot activity-specific questions using natural language.

## Copilot in automation center

Copilot in automation center enables makers, business analysts, and members of the Center of Excellence team to easily retrieve information about past flow runs, work queue performance, and general product features. You can get this information by asking questions in natural language.

## Enable or disable Copilot in Power Automate

If a region has GPUs (UK, Australia, US, India), we turn on Copilot by default. In this scenario, an admin needs to contact support and they'll use a PowerShell script to turn it off only at tenant level. Environment level support isn't available. If a region doesn't have GPUs (everywhere else except sovereign clouds), we turn on Copilot by default by toggling on the cross-geo data sharing. In this scenario, if you want to disable Copilot, you can toggle off the cross-geo data sharing in Power Platform admin center at the tenant level.
