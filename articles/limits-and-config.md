# Limits of automated, scheduled, and instant flows

This article contains information about the limits that apply to automated, scheduled, and instant flows, depending on which [Power Automate license](https://make.powerautomate.com/pricing) you have.

## Performance profiles

A flow's *performance profile* determines its Power Platform request limits. The following table describes the plans that are associated with each of the four performance profiles.

 To learn more about how Power Automate consumes Power Platform requests, go to [Types of Power Automate licenses - Power Platform requests](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types#power-platform-requests).

| Performance profile | Plans |
|---------------------|-------|
| Low                 | - Free <br />- Microsoft 365 plans <br /> - Power Apps Plan 1, Per App plans <br /> - Power Automate Plan 1 <br /> - All license trials <br>- Dynamics 365 Team Member<br>- Microsoft Power Apps for Developer | 
| Medium              | - Power Apps triggered flows, manual flows, child flows, Power Apps Plan 2, Power Apps per user plan <br />- Power Automate Plan 2, Power Automate Premium (previously Power Automate per user), Power Automate Premium plans (previously Power Automate per user with Attended RPA plans) <br /> Dynamics 365 Enterprise plans, Dynamics 365 Professional plans<br /> - [Dynamics 365 non-licensed users, application users, users with special free licenses](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations#non-licensed-usersapplication-usersusers-with-special-free-licenses)|
| High                | - Power Automate Process plan, Power Automate per flow plan |
| Unlimited Extended  | - Pay-as-you-go flows, Dynamics in context flows running under service principal  

If a user has multiple plans, such as a Microsoft 365 plan and a Dynamics 365 plan, the flow has the performance profile of the higher of the plans. For the exact set of plans that include Power Automate, refer to the [Power Platform licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2085130).

To determine which plan you have, select **Settings** on the Power Automate title bar, and then select **View My Licenses**.

:::image type="content" source="media/limits-and-config/my-licenses.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'View My Licenses' option in the 'Settings' menu.":::

A cloud flow uses the plan of its owner. If a cloud flow has been shared with multiple people, then generally the owner is the flow's creator. If you're unsure, you can use the [Web API](web-api.md) to change the owner. If the original owner leaves the organization, the flow reverts to the Low performance profile.

## Flow definition limits

The following table describes the limits for a single flow definition.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Actions per workflow | 500 | Flows with a large number of actions may encounter performance issues while you edit them, even if they have fewer than 500. Consider using child flows to reduce the number of actions in a single flow or if you need more than 500. |
| Allowed nesting depth for actions | 8 | Add child flows if you need more than eight levels of nesting. |
| Switch scope cases limit | 25 | |
| Variables per workflow | 250 | |
| Length of `action` or `trigger` name | 80 characters | |
| Characters per expression | 8,192 | |
| Length of `description` | 256 characters | |
| Maximum size of `trackedProperties` | 16,000 characters | |

## My flows limit

The following table describes the limit for the My flows and Team flows tabs.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Number of flows owned by a single user | 600 | Use flows under solutions if you need more than 600. |

## Duration and retention limits

The following tables describe the duration and retention limits.

### Duration limits

The following table describes the duration limits for a single flow run.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Run duration | 30 days | Run duration is calculated using a run's start time and includes flows with pending steps like approvals. After 30 days, any pending steps time out.|
| Run retention in storage | 30 days | Run retention is calculated using a run's start time. |
| Minimum recurrence interval | 60 seconds |
| Maximum recurrence interval | 500 days |
| Minimum postpone interval | 5 seconds for Low, 1 second for all other performance profiles |

### Retention limits

The following table describes the limits on how long flows remain turned on before they expire and get turned off.

| Name                 | Limit   | Notes |
|----------------------|---------|-------|
| Flows with errors    | 14 days |  A cloud flow that has a trigger or actions that fail continuously will be turned off. Fix your trigger or actions and turn on the  flow. These flows will have FlowSuspensionReason=AlwaysFailingDetected. |
| Not triggered (dormant) flows | 90 days for Free, Trial, Community and Microsoft 365 Plans. No expiration limit for all others. | A cloud flow that has no successful triggers will expire and be turned off. After 90 days of inactivity, the flow creator and co-owners will receive an email. If no action is taken in next 30 days, the flow will be systematically turned off, and the creator and co-owners will be notified in an email. For enterprise scenarios, we recommend you buy a standalone Power Automate license listed on [Power Automate pricing](https://make.powerautomate.com/pricing) to ensure your flow isnâ€™t turned off due to inactivity. You can turn your cloud flows back on anytime. These flows will have FlowSuspensionReason=NeverTriggeringDetected. |
| Consistently throttled flows | 14 days |A cloud flow that's consistently throttled for 14 days will be turned off. The flow creator and co-creators will get an email when the flow starts throttling and when the flow is turned off. For enterprise scenarios, we recommend you buy a standalone Power Automate license listed on [Power Automate pricing](https://make.powerautomate.com/pricing) to get higher action limits. You can turn your cloud flows back on anytime.|
|Premium flows without premium licenses| 14 days | Flows that were created with premium features (premium connectors, custom connectors, HTTP connectors, on premises gateway, and business process flows) but don't have a premium Power Automate license will be turned off after 14 days. This situation happens if the original owner leaves the organization, or if they have an expired trial or premium license. The flow owner and co-owners will get an email when the trial or premium license expires, or when the owner isn't found in Microsoft Entra ID (Microsoft Entra ID). The flow will continue to work for 14 days. If a premium license isn't assigned to the flow within 14 days, the flow is automatically turned off, and the owner and co-owners are notified through email. Newly created or edited premium flows without a premium license are saved but turned off. Once a premium Power Automate license is assigned to the owner or flow, you can turn on the flow. Admins can [find these flows](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/faqs#how-can-i-identify-flows-that-need-premium-licenses-to-avoid-interruptions). Assign a Power Automate Process license or a per user license to the owner to keep the flow running.|

## Concurrency, looping, and debatching limits

The following table describes the concurrency, looping, and debatching limits for a single flow run.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Concurrent runs | - Unlimited for flows with Concurrency Control turned off<br />- 1 to 100 when Concurrency Control is turned on (defaults to 25) | This is the limit for how many runs a flow can have at the same time. <br />**Note**: Concurrency Control is set in the flow's trigger settings and is off by default. Turning on Concurrency Control can't be undone without deleting and re-adding the trigger.
| Waiting runs | - Not applicable when Concurrency Control is off  <br /> - 10 plus the degree of parallelism (1-100) when Concurrency Control is on| This limit describes the highest number of flow runs that can be queued when the flow is at its maximum number of concurrent runs. <br />**Note**: Additional triggers that arrive while the waiting runs limit is met might be re-tried by the connector. However, the retry attempts might not succeed if the maximum waiting limit continues to be met for an extended period of time. To ensure all triggers result in flow runs, leave the Concurrency Control setting off in the flow's trigger.
| Apply to each array item | 5,000 for Low, 100,000 for all others | This limit describes the highest number of array items that an "apply to each" loop can process. <br />To filter larger arrays, you can use the query action. |
| Apply to each concurrency | 1 is the default limit. You can change the default to a value between 1 and 50 inclusively. | This limit is highest number of "apply to each" loop iterations that can run at the same time, or in parallel. |
| Split on items | - 5,000 for Low without trigger concurrency  <br />- 100,000 for all others without trigger concurrency <br />- 100 with trigger concurrency | For triggers that return an array, you can specify an expression that uses a 'SplitOn' property that splits or debatches array items into multiple workflow instances for processing, rather than use a "Foreach" loop. This expression references the array to use for creating and running a workflow instance for each array item. <br />**Note**: When concurrency is turned on, the Split on limit is reduced to 100 items. |
| Until iterations | - Default: 60 <br />- Maximum: 5,000 | |
| Paginated items | 5,000 for Low, 100,000 for all others | To process more items, trigger multiple flow runs over your data. |

## Throughput limits

The following sections describe the time-bound limits for a single version of a cloud flow definition. These limits apply across all runs of the flow version and are calculated on sliding windows.

If a cloud flow exceeds one of the limits, flow activity is slowed. It automatically resumes when the sliding window has activity below the limit. However, if a cloud flow [consistently remains above the limits](#duration-and-retention-limits) for 14 days, it's turned off. Be sure to monitor email for notifications about such flows. If a cloud flow consistently exceeds the limits, you need to revise it to remain below the limits to prevent it from being turned off.

> [!TIP]
> Because these limits are for a single version, if you update your flow, it resets the limits.

### Power Platform request limits

As of October 2019, there are limits on the number of [Power Platform requests](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types#power-platform-requests) an account can make across all its flows, Power Apps, and any applications that call Dataverse. No performance is guaranteed above these limits, although enforcement of the limits isn't as strict during the [licensing transition period](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types#transition-period). [Learn more about request limits and allocations](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations).

These requests are counted for all types of actions, including connector actions, HTTP actions, and built-in actions, from initializing variables to a simple compose action. Both successful and failed actions count toward the limits. Retries and requests from pagination also count as action runs.

To view the number of actions your flow has run, select **Analytics** on the flow details page and check the **Actions** tab.

The following table describes the limits on requests.

| Name | Transition period limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |----- |
| Power platform requests per 5 minutes | 100,000 | Distribute the workload across more than one flow as necessary. |
| Power platform requests per 24 hours |10,000 for Low; 200,000 for Medium; 500,000 for High; 10,000,000 for Unlimited Extended | These limits represent approximations of how many requests are allowed daily. They aren't guarantees. Actual amounts may be smaller, but will be greater than the [documented request limits and allocations](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations) during the [licensing transition period](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types#transition-period). The documented limits were substantially increased in late 2021. [View detailed Power Platform request usage information in the Power Platform admin center (preview)](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations#view-detailed-power-platform-request-usage-information-in-the-power-platform-admin-center-preview). Any potential enforcement of high usage based on the [documented limits](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations) wouldn't start until six months after reports have been made generally available. Distribute the workload across more than one flow as necessary. |
| Concurrent outbound calls | 500 for Low; 2,500 for all others | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |

> [!TIP]
> Individual connectors have their own limits, which often are reached before the limits mentioned previously. Be sure to check the [documentation for your connector](/connectors/).

### Runtime endpoint request limits

The runtime endpoint is the direct access URL for a given flow. It starts with something like: `https://prod-00.westus.logic.azure.com:443/`.

The following table describes the limits on runtime endpoint requests.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Concurrent inbound calls | ~1,000 | You can reduce the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as necessary. |
| Read calls per 5 minutes  | 6,000 for Low; 60,000 for all others | This limit applies to calls that get the raw inputs and outputs from a cloud flow's run history. You can distribute the workload across more than one flow as necessary. |
| Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 4,500 for Low; 45,000 for all others | You can distribute workload across more than one flow as necessary. |

### Content throughput limits

The following table describes the content throughput limits, which refer to the amount of data that's read from or written to the run history of the cloud flow.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Content throughput per 5 minutes | 120 MB for Low; 1.2 GB for all others | You can distribute workload across more than one flow as necessary. |
| Content throughput per 24 hours | 200 MB for Low; 2 GB for Medium; 10 GB for High | You can distribute workload across more than one flow as necessary. |

## Gateway limits

Power Automate supports write operations, including inserts and updates, through the gateway. However, these operations have [limits on their payload size](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem#considerations).

## Request limits

The following sections describe the limits for a single outgoing or incoming HTTP call.

### Timeout

Some connector operations make asynchronous calls or listen for webhook requests, so the timeout for these operations might be longer than these limits. For more information, refer to the technical details for the specific connector.

The following table describes the timeout limits.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Outbound synchronous request | 120 seconds (2 minutes) | Examples of outbound requests include calls made by HTTP triggers.<br/>**Tip**: For longer-running operations, use an asynchronous polling pattern or an "Until" loop. To work around timeout limits when you call another flow that has a callable endpoint, use the built-in action instead, which you can find in the connector picker under **Built-in**. |
| Outbound asynchronous request | Configurable up to 30 days |  |
| Inbound request | 120 seconds (2 minutes) | Examples of inbound requests include requests to trigger instant flows and flows with the **HTTP Request** trigger.<br/>Flows that contain a response action including **Respond to Copilot**, **HTTP Response**, and **Respond to a PowerApp or flow** will always return a response within this limit.<br/>Child flows that are started before the response action will continue running separately, and actions after the response action will continue running beyond this limit, enabling a flow to respond and continue running other operations. |

If you test a cloud flow that runs for longer than 10 minutes, you may get a timeout message in Power Automate, even though the flow continues to run in the background. If this happens, reopen the view to receive the current status.

### Message size

The following table describes the limits on message size.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Message size | 100 MB | To work around this limit, consider allowing chunking under the action content transfer settings. However, some connectors and APIs might not support chunking or even the default limit. <br />**Note**: When sending files through a connector, the overall size of the payload and not just the file needs to be under 100 MB.|
| Message size with chunking | 1 GB | This limit applies to actions that either natively support chunking or let you enable chunking in their runtime configuration. |

### Character limits

The following table describes the limits on the number of characters in expressions and request URLs.

| Name | Limit | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Expression evaluation limit | 131,072 characters | The `@concat()`, `@base64()`, and `@string()` expressions can't be longer than this limit. |
| Request URL character limit | 16,384 characters |

### Retry policy

The following sections describe the limits on retries when a flow fails.

#### Default retry policy

The following table describes the default retry limits.

| Performance profile | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Low | This policy sends up to two retries at *exponentially increasing* intervals, which scale by 5 minutes up to an interval of approximately 10 minutes for the last retry. |
| Medium, High | This policy sends up to eight retries at *exponentially increasing* intervals, which scale by 7 seconds up to an interval of approximately 15 minutes for the last retry. |

#### Retry setting limits

The following table describes the limits on retry settings.

To change the default settings, use the retry policy parameter.

| Name | Limit |
| ---- | ----- |
| Retry attempts | 90 |
| Retry maximum delay | 1 day |
| Retry minimum delay | 5 seconds |

[Learn more about retry policies](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-exception-handling#retry-policies).

## Turn off or delete flows

When you turn off a cloud flow, no new runs are started. All in-progress and pending runs continue until they finish.

When you delete a cloud flow, no new runs are started. All in-progress and pending runs are canceled. If you have thousands of runs, cancellation might take significant time to complete.

## Custom connector limits

The following table describes the limits on custom connectors that you can create from web APIs.

| Name | Limit |  Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Number of custom connectors | 50 per user | |
| Number of requests per minute for a custom connector | 500 requests per minute per connection | |

You must have a premium or trial license to run any flow that uses a custom connector.

## SharePoint limits

There are [limitations](/connectors/sharepointonline/#limits) on how you can use Microsoft SharePoint with Power Automate and Power Apps.

[!INCLUDE [sharepoint-detailed-docs](includes/sharepoint-detailed-docs.md)]

## IP addresses

Requests from Power Automate use IP addresses that are associated with the [region of the environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview#manage-environments-in-the-power-platform-admin-center) in which your flow exists.

Calls made from connectors in cloud flows come from [these IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform). Add them to your network's allowlist to facilitate communications from Power Automate.

## Allowlist of namespaces endpoints required for runtime

By default, administrators need to authorize endpoints, including **\*.servicebus.windows.net**, to allow desktop flow runs. If you don't want to authorize this public endpoint, you can alternatively allow all the following namespace endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of namespace endpoints can evolve. Therefore, you should regularly check this page to keep your authorized endpoints up to date.

| **URI**                                                                   | **Power Platform Region** | **Is preview** |

## Other configuration details

For information about how to permit access to automated, scheduled, and instant flows, including required endpoints, refer to [IP address configuration](ip-address-configuration.md).

## Flow suspension because of runtime limits

Suspended flows are shown as suspended in the Power Automate maker portal and the Power Platform admin center. When a flow is returned through an API, PowerShell, or a [Power Automate Management connector list flows 'as Admin' action](/connectors/flowmanagement/#list-flows-as-admin), the flow has **State=Suspended** with appropriate **FlowSuspensionReason** and **FlowSuspensionTime** values.

The following are the FlowSuspensionReason values for runtime limits:

- AllActionsFailingDetected
- AlwaysFailingDetected
- ApiCallOverageDetected
- BillingConsumption
- BillingConsumptionMissingRPALicense
- NeverTriggeringDetected
