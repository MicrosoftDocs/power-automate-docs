# Export and import a non-solution flow

You can export and import non-solution flows by using packages. This feature allows you to export one flow from one environment and import it to another. Export and import packages have the file format *.zip*.

If you would like to export and import multiple flows, you can either use solutions, as described in the [Export a solution](export-flow-solution.md#export-a-specific-solution-cloud-flow) and [Import a solution](/power-automate/import-flow-solution) articles, or you can [copy an environment](/power-platform/admin/copy-environment).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You must have [third party cookies](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/widget-cookies-pop-up-error) enabled to export and import non-solution flows .
> - For application lifecycle management (ALM) capabilities in Microsoft Power Platform environments, use Microsoft Dataverse and solutions instead of the package export and import. More information: [Overview of ALM](/power-platform/alm/overview-alm)
> - Flow packages can't be used with [Dataverse solution packages](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solutions-overview) because of the package incompatibility.

## Resources included in the package

When you export a flow, the dependent resources for your flow are also exported into the package.

|Resource | Supported | Import options |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Flow | Yes | There are two options to import a flow into an environment:</li><li>**Create as new**: The flow is created as a new flow into the environment where the package is imported.</li><li>**Update**: The flow already exists in the environment and is updated when this package is imported. |

## Permissions required to import and export a non-solution flow

Only the [owner or co-owner](/sharepoint/dev/business-apps/power-automate/guidance/manage-list-flows) of a flow can export the flow. To import a flow, the [Environment Maker](/power-platform/admin/database-security) is required on the destination environment.

## Export a flow package

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. On the left navigation pane, select **My Flows** > **Cloud flows**, and then select the flow you want to export.
1. On the menu, select the down arrow next to **Export**, and then select **Package (.zip)**.
1. On the next screen, enter a name and description for your package.
1. *(Optional)* Configure the package.
    1. Under **Review Package Content** in the **ACTION** field, select **Configure** (the tool icon).
    1. Select **Update (default**) or **Create as new**.  

        For a description of these options, go to the table in the [Resources included in the package](#resources-included-in-the-package) section in this article.

    1. Select **Save**.

    1. Select **Save**. The icon in the **ACTION** column now contains quotation marks to indicate there's a comment.

1. On the bottom right corner, select **Export**.

    Your package starts downloading shortly after. If your download doesn't start automatically, select **Download**.
