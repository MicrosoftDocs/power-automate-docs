# Respond to personal data discovery requests (Microsoft Entra ID)

The first step in responding to personal data requests is to find personal data that's subject to the request. This step helps you to determine whether a request meets your organization's requirements for honoring or declining the request.

The following table summarizes the Power Automate resources that may contain the personal data of a user who authenticates using Microsoft Entra ID.

| **Resource** | **Purpose** |
| ----- | ----- |
| System-generated logs | Records that capture system events and history. |
| Run history | The history of each flow execution for the past 28 days, including the start time, end time, status, and all inputs and outputs. [Learn more](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/download-history-recurrence/). |
| Activity feed | Recaps flow activities, including run status, failures, and notifications. |
| User jobs | Not visible to the user; system jobs that run on behalf of a user for flows to execute. |
| Flows | The workflow logic that exists for a cloud flow. [Learn more](./get-started-logic-flow.md). |

| User details | Not visible to the user; details that support flow execution. |

| Gateway | Gateways are on-premises data services that users can install to transfer data quickly and securely between Power Automate and a data source that isn't in the cloud. [Learn more](./gateway-manage.md). |
