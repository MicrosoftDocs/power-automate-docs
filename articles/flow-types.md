# What is Power Automate?

With its automation capabilities, Power Automate helps you streamline your business processes and automate repetitive tasks. Its intuitive interface and many connectors allow you to create workflows with little to no knowledge of coding. You can drag and drop components and set up workflows to save time and improve efficiency. Power Automate can handle simple tasks like sending notifications as well as more complex processes across multiple apps and services. It's flexible and scalable, making it useful for various automation needs in a modern workplace.

## Types of flows

Power Automate provides three types of flows to meet different automation needs. Each type of flow is designed for specific scenarios and can be used independently or in combination with others.

Select one of the following types for an overview of what it can do:

- [Cloud flows](overview-cloud.md): Create a cloud flow when you want your automation to be triggered either automatically, instantly, or via a schedule.
- [Desktop flows](./desktop-flows/introduction.md): Use desktop flows to automate tasks on the web or the desktop.
- [Business process flows](business-process-flows-overview.md): Use business process flows to guide users through a defined set of steps in a business process. This is especially useful for ensuring consistency and compliance in processes that require user input. This user experience can be tailored so that people with different security roles can have an experience that best suits the work they do.

## Create and manage flows in Power Apps

Your Power Automate license gives you rights to create and manage flows in Power Apps. For example, after you sign in to Power Apps, you can select **Flows** on the left navigation pane. You can also create and manage flows through the [Power Automate pane](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-flows) within Power Apps Studio.
