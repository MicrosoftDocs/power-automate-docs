# Overview of the different types of flows

Power Automate is a service that you can use to automate repetitive tasks to bring efficiencies to any organizations.

You can create [cloud flows](#cloud-flows), [desktop flows](#desktop-flows), or [business process flows](#business-process-flows).

Check out this video about the different types of flows.

## Cloud flows

Create a cloud flow when you want your automation to be triggered either automatically, instantly, or via a schedule.

| **Flow type**      | **Use case**       | **Automation target**     |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| [Automated flows](get-started-logic-flow.md)                 | Create an automation that is triggered by an event such as arrival of an email from a specific person, or a mention of your company in social media.| [Connectors](/connectors/) for cloud or on-premises services connect your accounts and enable them to talk to each other. |
| [Instant flows](./mobile/mobile-create-flow.md)   | Start an automation with a click of a button. You can automate for repetitive tasks from your Desktop or Mobile devices. For example, instantly send a reminder to the team with a push of a button from your mobile device.     |     Wide range of tasks such as requesting an approval, an action in Teams or SharePoint.       |
| [Scheduled flows](run-scheduled-tasks.md)                    | Schedule an automation such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database.             |Tasks that need to be automated on a schedule.         |

## Desktop flows

Use [desktop flows](./desktop-flows/introduction.md) to automate tasks on the Web or the desktop.

## Business process flows

[Business process flows](business-process-flows-overview.md) provide a guide for people to get work done. They provide a streamlined user experience that leads people through the processes their organization has defined for interactions that need to be advanced to a conclusion of some kind. This user experience can be tailored so that people with different security roles can have an experience that best suits the work they do.
