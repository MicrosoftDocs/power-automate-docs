# Glossary in process advisor

**Activity**&mdash;Activities in process advisor describe tasks or actions, the sequence of which results in a business process. Activities can be performed by humans or (automated) by machines.

**Attributes**&mdash;Attributes are the dimensions of your data. Also known as columns.

**Contributor**&mdash;A role which can create and upload recordings to a task mining process. Contributors can label and manage their own recordings, but they can't edit the process or other people’s recordings.

**Co-owner**&mdash;A role which has similar privileges to the process owner roles. They can edit the process and its recordings, invite people to the process, manage activate label templates, and more. 

**Dataflow**&mdash;A self-service, cloud-based, data preparation technology that enables customers to ingest, transform, and load data into Microsoft Dataverse environments, Power BI workspaces, or the organization's Azure Data Lake Storage account.

**Data Lake**&mdash;Azure Data Lake includes all the capabilities required to make it easy for developers, data scientists, and analysts to store data of any size, shape, and speed, and do all types of processing and analytics across platforms and languages.

**Data source**&mdash;Where the source event log data is located. Dataflow accesses different data sources through its connectors.

**Event logs**&mdash;Tabular data of processes (or cases) and activities stored in an information system of record. The minimum column requirements for process mining are case ID, activity ID, and start timestamp. Also known as event data.

**Power Query**&mdash;A data transformation and data preparation engine. Power Query comes with a graphical interface for getting data from sources and a Power Query Editor for applying transformations. Learn more: [What is Power Query?](/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query)

**Process**&mdash;A series of activities taken to accomplish a goal. Planning demand and converting purchase requisition to purchase orders are examples of processes. 

**Process map**&mdash;Visualizes the actual flow of your process based on the imported user or system data.

**Process mining**&mdash;Visualization and analysis of processes based on event logs. Event logs are information stored in information systems. For example, in CRM (Customer Relationship Management), you can find event logs on orders, start and completion of an activity, resources used, and more.

**Recording**&mdash;A recorded sequence of activities that users perform on their desktop. Usually, multiple recordings are analyzed together to get insights into different variants of the same task.

**Robotic process automation (RPA)**&mdash;Software that can be easily programmed to do basic, repetitive tasks across applications.

**Task mining**&mdash;Technology that captures users’ interaction with computers and analyzes how people get jobs done, and how they can do them better.

**Variant**&mdash;A specific path it takes for a process to be completed.

**Workflow**&mdash;The sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.
