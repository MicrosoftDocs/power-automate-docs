Each scenario includes a step-by-step guide to help you create the cloud flow. If you have access to Copilot, select the **Using copilot** tab to create your flow. If you don't have access to Copilot, select the **Without copilot** tab.

After you create a cloud flow, you can configure it in the *designer*. The designer is where you can add, remove, and edit actions in your flow.

You can configure your cloud flow in either the *new designer* or the *classic designer*. The default designer is the new designer, which is available to all users. The classic designer is available to users who prefer the classic experience, or whose admin turned off the new designer feature.
