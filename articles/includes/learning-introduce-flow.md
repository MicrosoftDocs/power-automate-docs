Welcome to Guided Learning for Power Automate. This **self-paced online course** explains Power Automate in a sequential way so that you can build your knowledge from the ground up. The course is designed to provide **guidance in understandable chunks** with lots of **visuals and examples**, following a logical progression to help you learn principles and details.

In this course, you'll learn about Power Automate and its concepts, see how to **build flows**, **manage them**, and **administer them** in your environment. You'll be presented with information and scenarios for a fictional company called Contoso Flooring, but you'll see how to use the same scenarios in your business or your clients' businesses.

If you're a beginner with Power Automate, this course will get you going. If you already have some experience, this course will tie concepts together and fill in the gaps. This course is a work in progress, so **please let us know how we're doing** and what other topics you want to see in this course.

## What is Power Automate?
Power Automate is an online **workflow service** that enables you to work smarter and more efficiently by **automating workflows** across the most common apps and services. For example, you can create a cloud flow that adds a lead to **Dynamics 365** and a record in **MailChimp** whenever someone with more than 100 followers tweets about your company.

When you sign up, you can **connect to more than 100 services** and **manage data in either the cloud or on-premises sources** such as SharePoint and SQL Server. The list of applications and services that you can use with Power Automate grows constantly.

## What can you do with Power Automate?
You can use Power Automate to **automate workflows** between your favorite **applications and services**, synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and more. 

For example, you can **automate** these tasks:

* Instantly respond to high-priority notifications or emails.
* Capture, track, and follow up with new sales leads.
* Copy files from one service to another.
* Collect data about your business, and share that information with your team.
* Automate approval workflows.

A common use of Power Automate is to **receive notifications**. For example, you can instantly receive an email or a push notification on your phone whenever a sales lead is added to Dynamics 365 or Salesforce.

You can also **use Power Automate to copy files**. For example, you can ensure that any file that's added to Dropbox gets **automatically copied** to SharePoint where your team can find it.

You can **monitor what people are saying** about your business by creating a cloud flow that runs whenever **someone sends a tweet** with a certain hashtag. The flow could put details about that tweet into a SQL Server database, a SharePoint list, or even an Excel file hosted on OneDrive--whichever service works for you. With the data that you collect, you can create actions to connect it to Power BI, spot trends, and ask questions about the data.

And finally, **you can automate approval loops** for, as an example, vacation requests in a SharePoint list.

For more ideas, **browse our list of templates**, which help you build flows in just a few steps. For example, you can easily build flows to **send yourself weather forecasts**, reminders at regular intervals, or phone notifications whenever your manager sends you mail.

## Where can I create and administer a cloud flow?
You can create a cloud flow and perform administrative tasks **in a browser** or **on your phone** - if you download the mobile app for Power Automate.

You can perform these tasks, among others:

* Turn flows on or off from wherever you are.
* See when a cloud flow has failed.
* Review detailed run-history reports.
* View and filter runs by notification type.
