* [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
* A SharePoint Online list.

> [!NOTE]
> While we use SharePoint Online and Office 365 Outlook in this tutorial, you can use other services such as Zendesk, Salesforce, or Gmail. If you're using SharePoint 2010, learn more in [SharePoint 2010 workflow retirement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138686)

Before you create the flow, create a [SharePoint Online list](https://support.office.com/article/Training-Create-and-set-up-a-list-1DDC1F5A-A908-478B-BB6D-608F34B71F94). Later, you use this list to request approval for vacations.
