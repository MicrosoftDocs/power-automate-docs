The blue recommendation icons on the process map activity show the automation opportunities.

When you select **+Automate activities** above the process map, you'll be taken to Power Automate form designer. This is where you'll see the connector recommendations for the activities in your process map. You can select and add the connectors to your flow to automate your process.
