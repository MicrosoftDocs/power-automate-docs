## More options to find your flow

If you can't find your flow, try one of the options in the following table.

|Scenario  |Solution  |
|---------|---------|
|The flow might be in a different environment.      | To change environments, go to [Environment information and settings](getting-started.md#3--environment-information-and-settings).      |
|The flow was shared.   | Check the **Shared with me** tab in **My Flows** menu option. (For an example, refer to the screenshot in [Find your flows easily](#find-your-flows-easily) in this article.)       |
| You might have been removed as an owner of the flow.    |  Contact the flow owner to be re-added. To find out if you’re an owner of the flow, go to [Remove an owner](create-team-flows.md#remove-an-owner).       |
| The flow might have been deleted.     | To restore the flow, go to [Restore deleted flows](how-tos-restore-deleted-flow.md).        |
