# Overview of cloud flows

You can choose from three cloud flow options depending on what you want to automate. An *automated cloud flow* creates an automation that's triggered by an event such as the  arrival of an email from a specific person, or a mention of your company in social media. An *instant cloud flow* starts an automation with the selection of a button. A *scheduled cloud flow* starts a scheduled automation such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database.

| **Flow type**     | **Use case**         | **Automation target**          |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| [Automated flows](get-started-logic-flow.md)                 | Create an automation that is triggered by an event such as arrival of an email from a specific person, or a mention of your company in social media.| [Connectors](/connectors/) for cloud or on-premises services connect your accounts and enable them to talk to each other. |
| [Instant flows](./mobile/mobile-create-flow.md)              | Start an automation with the selection of a button. You can automate for repetitive tasks from your desktop or mobile devices. For example, instantly send a reminder to the team with a push of a button from your mobile device.                      |     Wide range of tasks such as requesting an approval, an action in Teams or SharePoint.       |
| [Scheduled flows](run-scheduled-tasks.md)                    | Schedule an automation such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database.             |Tasks that need to be automated on a schedule. |

## Find your flows easily

You might have a need to find a flow within a large number of flows. Finding your flows is easy&mdash;just use the search box on the **Cloud flows**, **Desktop flows**, or **Shared with me** tab to display only flows that match the search terms you enter.

## More options to find your flow

If you can't find your flow, try one of the options in the following table.

|Scenario  |Solution  |
|---------|---------|
|The flow/might be in a different environment.      | To change environments, go to /Environment information and settings](getting-started.md#3--environment-information-and-settings).      |
|The flow was shared.   | Check the **Shared with me** tab in **My Flows** menu option. (For an example, refer to the screenshot in [Find your flows easily](#find-your-flows-easily) in this article.)       |
| You might have been removed as an owner of the flow.    |  Contact the flow owner to be re-added. To find out if youâ€™re an owner of the flow, go to [Remove an owner](create-team-flows.md#remove-an-owner).       |
| The flow might have been deleted.     | To restore the flow, go to [Restore deleted flows](how-tos-restore-deleted-flow.md).        |
