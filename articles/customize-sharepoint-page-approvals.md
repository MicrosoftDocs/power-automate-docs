# Manage SharePoint page approvals with Power Automate

SharePoint site admins can use Power Automate to require new or updated site pages to be approved before being published.

In this article, you'll learn how to configure your SharePoint site to use a cloud flow to require changes to the site to be approved before they go live.

>[!NOTE]
>SharePoint approvals isn't available in government cloud environments.

## Configure SharePoint for page approvals

### Prerequisites

You must be a SharePoint site admin to perform the activities in this article.

[!INCLUDE [sharepoint-detailed-docs](includes/sharepoint-detailed-docs.md)]

1. Sign in to SharePoint as a site admin.
1. Select **Pages** from the navigation bar.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows the pages menu item.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/pages.png "Pages menu item")

1. Select **Automate** > **Power Automate** > **Configure page approval flow**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows the configure page approval flow option.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/select-page-approval-flow.png "Configure page approval flow option")

1. Select **Create flow**.

1. Optionally, you might need to sign in to the services that this Power Automate template uses.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Provide a **Flow name**, at least one name in the **Approvers** box, and then select **Create**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows the create menu item.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/flow-name-approvers-create.png "Create menu item")

Your flow is complete. Now, each time a page is added or modified, an approval request goes to the **Approvers** you listed in the flow.

The page approval flow is just like any other flow, so it's listed in the **My flows** tab.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot that shows the My flows menu item.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/page-approval-flow-success.png "My flows menu item")

## Submit a page for approval

Now that you've created a page approval flow, anyone who adds or changes a page will need to do the following steps.

 1. Make a change to the site (add a new page, for example) and then save the change.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows the create option.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/create-new-page.png "Create option")

 1. Wait for someone to approve the change.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot that shows when approval is pending.](media/customize-sharepoint-page-approvals/wait-for-approval.png "Approval is pending")

## Approve a page

Approvers receive an email whenever there's a page approval request. They can approve the requests directly in the email if their email client supports actionable messages. Alternatively, they can open the page from the email to review, and then approve the page in SharePoint.

## Customize page approval flows

Because page approvals use Power Automate behind the scenes, the page approval flow is available for site owners to modify and add any custom business logic in the flow. To modify the flow, the site owner can select **Flows** and then select **See your flows** in the pages library to find the page approval flow.

## Limitations

Only the specific triggers and actions that are used by a page approval flow are supported for use on a Pages library. All other SharePoint triggers and actions aren't supported.
