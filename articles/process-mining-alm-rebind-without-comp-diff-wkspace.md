# Rebind reports without using a composite model (different workspaces)

If you linked your process in Test environment to a workspace (for example, WkSpace B) that's different from the one used by the process in Dev environment (for example, WkSpace A), follow the steps in this article.

## Attach a workspace to your process

[!INCLUDE[alm-attach-workspace](./includes/alm-attach-workspace.md)]
[!INCLUDE[alm-attach-wwith-and-without](./includes/alm-attach-with-and-without.md)]

## Rebind the Power BI report

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://msit.powerbi.com/).
1. From the left navigation pane, select **Workspaces** > your **WkSpace A**.
1. In your **WkSpace A**, select your **Report A**.
1. To download the report, from the command bar, select **File** > **Download this file** > **"A copy of your report with a live connection…"** > **Download**.
1. Open the downloaded report in Power BI for desktop.
1. After you edit the report, select **Transform data** > **Data source settings** from the command bar in the **Home** tab.
1. From the list of semantic models, select the semantic model of the process that's in your **WkSpace B** workspace, and then select **Connect**.

    This is called *rebinding*. The report refreshes. Learn more about semantic models in [Semantic models in the Power BI service](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-understand).

1. From the command bar, save the report by selecting **Save**.
1. From the command bar, publish the report by selecting **Publish**.
1. From the **Publish to Power BI** menu, select your **WkSpace B** > **Select**.

    A message that says **Replacing report** appears because you retained the report name.

1. Select **Replace** to overwrite the old report in WkSpace B. This action overwrites the existing report with an updated version that incorporates the new customizations. It also preserves the original report name for consistency.

1. When this process completes, return to Power BI and open **WkSpace B**.

    The report is now successfully migrated from WkSpace A and is connected to the semantic model of the process you had in your WkSpace B.
