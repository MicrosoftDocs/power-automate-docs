# Sign up and sign in for Power Automate

Starting with Power Automate, as an individual, is easy! Before you can create a cloud flow, sign up by using any email address. If you've never used an online Microsoft product with that address, you'll need to take a few moments to register it.

## Sign up free

If you haven't used other online Microsoft products, you'll need to sign up.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Try free** in the upper-right corner.
2. Enter your email address.
3. Select the right arrow.

## Sign in

If you've used other Microsoft online products, either for work or yourself, all you need to do is sign in.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

1. On the sign-in page, enter your email address and password.

## Using paid features

Anyone can sign up and get a free plan for Power Automate. If your organization has purchased Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365, you may already have access to Power Automate. You can also start a 90-day free trial or purchase a Power Automate license if you want to use any of the paid features. [Learn more about billing](billing-questions.md).

For administration information, see [Flows in your organization Q&A](organization-q-and-a.md).

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, you can register for Power Automate by following the simple process described earlier in this topic. However, this table summarizes the most common reasons why you may not be able to sign up and describes available workarounds.

For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com, but your ID might be nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to you for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services. |
