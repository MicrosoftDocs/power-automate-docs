# Sign up and sign in for Power Automate

Starting with Power Automate, as an individual, is easy! Before you can create a cloud flow, sign up by using any email address. If you've never used an online Microsoft product with that address, you'll need to take a few moments to register it.

## Sign up free

If you haven't used other online Microsoft products, you'll need to sign up.

1. In [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Try free** in the upper-right corner.
2. Enter your email address.
3. Select the right arrow.

## Sign in

If you've used other Microsoft online products, either for work or yourself, all you need to do is sign in.

1. In [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

1. On the sign-in page, enter your email address and password.
1. After you've signed in, you'll see a product consent dialog that asks you to consent to the [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/), and asks you to sign up for marketing and promotional emails from Power Automate. If you agree to the terms and conditions, you'll be able to start using Power Automate. 

## Use paid features

Anyone can sign up and get a free plan for Power Automate. If your organization has purchased Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365, you may already have access to Power Automate. You can also start a 90 day free trial, or purchase a Power Automate license if you want to use the paid features. [Learn more about billing](billing-questions.md).

For administration information, go to [Flows in your organization Q&A](organization-q-and-a.md).

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, you can register for Power Automate by following the simple process described previously in this topic. However, this table summarizes the most common reasons why you might not be able to sign up, and describes available workarounds.
