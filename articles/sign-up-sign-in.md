# Sign up and sign in for Power Automate

Before you can create a cloud flow, sign up by using a Microsoft work or school email address. If you never used an online Microsoft product with that address, you need to register it.

## Sign up free

If you didn't use other online Microsoft products before, you need to sign up.

1. In [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Try free** in the upper-right corner.
1. Enter your Microsoft work or school email address.
1. Select the right arrow.

## Sign in

If you did use other Microsoft online products, all you need to do is sign in.

1. In [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

1. On the sign-in page, enter your Microsoft work or school email address and password.
1. After you signed in, a product consent dialog displays to ask you to consent to the [Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/subscription-agreement/). It also asks you to sign up for marketing and promotional emails from Power Automate. If you agree to the terms and conditions, you're able to start using Power Automate.

## Use paid features

Anyone can sign up and get a free plan for Power Automate. If your organization purchased Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365, you might already have access to Power Automate. You can also start a 90 day free trial, or purchase a Power Automate license if you want to use the paid features. [Learn more about billing](billing-questions.md).

## Troubleshooting

In many cases, you can register for Power Automate by following the process described previously in this article. However, this table summarizes the most common reasons why you might not be able to sign up, and describes available workarounds.

| Symptom / error message  | Cause and workaround   |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| **No Microsoft account created yet** <br> You receive a message after entering your email during signup:<br><br> *That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one.*    |  You signed up with an email that doesn't yet have a Microsoft account created for it. Select the **Sign up now** link on that page and you can create a new Microsoft account for your email.  |
|**.gov or .mil email addresses**<br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br><br>*Power Automate unavailable: Power Automate isn't available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses. Use a Microsoft work or school email address.*   |  You can't sign up for Power Automate with a .gov or .mil address. Instead, you can sign in with a Microsoft work or school email address.   |
| **Self-service signup disabled**<br><br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br>*We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department turned off signup for Power Automate. Contact them to complete signup.* <br>or<br> *We can't finish signing you up. It looks like Microsoft Power Automate isn't currently available for your work or school.* |     You selected **Sign up** instead of of **Sign in**. If you select **Sign in** in the top of the home page, you're able to access Power Automate.  |
|**Email address is not an Office 365 ID**<br><br>You receive a message like the following during signup:<br>*We can't find you at contoso.com. Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with a Microsoft work or school email address, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.*   | Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Office 365 and other Microsoft services, and those IDs differ from your Microsoft work or school email address. For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com, but your ID might be nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use your Microsoft work or school email address. |
