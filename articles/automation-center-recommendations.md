# Automation center recommendations

The automation center offers targeted recommendations aimed at enhancing the reliability, efficiency, and general health of your automation. You can find actionable insights such as:

- real-time recommendation of automations starting to fail
- warnings of work queues potentially failing to meet their service level agreement (SLA) objectives
- identification of unused machines or machine groups in the environment
- many more

## Key capabilities

Key features of recommendations:

- Get proactive and reactive recommendations, grounded on best practices.
- Enhance the overall health, compliance, and performance of automation across your environment.
- Take corrective actions directly from the list of affected automation artifacts.

## Prerequisites

To see and use recommendations in automation center, the following are required:

- From December 2024 (general availability), a Dataverse environment with [managed environment](/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-enable) enabled.
- Premium Power Automate license
- Environment maker role (or other roles that include access to recommendation data)

## Recommendation details

Recommendations appear as cards in the carousel found at the top of the automation center's overview page. Each recommendation is uniquely generated per recommendation type, user, and refresh interval, and is stored in the `Flow Events` ([flowevent](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/flowevent)) table in Dataverse. This design provides important permission granularity, ensuring that the recommendations each user receives align with their specific access rights to the underlying artifacts. If a user doesn't have permission to view the underlying flow, work queue, or any related artifact related to the recommendation, those recommendations aren't generated for them.

### Recommendation card

The recommendation card shown in the following image is the entry point to your recommendations. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the card’s components:

## List of recommendations

The following list of recommendations aims to provide proactive guidance and actionable insights for optimizing and troubleshooting various aspects of your automations. From addressing work queue SLA violations and capacity overages to improving system resilience and efficiency, each recommendation offers a detailed proposed solution or more details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Recommendations that don't have a real time refresh frequency hold data snapshots from when the recommendation was generated. As a result, if you revisit an older recommendation, the information displayed under artifact details may no longer be accurate or applicable.
> - If you're a premium Power Automate user and it's your first time accessing the automation center, we will begin generating recommendations for you. These should be ready for your review in about an hour or two.
> - Generation of recommendations is paused if you don't return to the automation center within 7 days, your premium license was unassigned by your IT team, or your trial expired.
> - The recommendations shown as part of the automation center are intra-environmental recommendations targeted to makers, operators, and CoE team members. If you are looking for admin related, tenant-wide recommendations in Power Platform admin center, these are part of a separate feature called [**Power Platform Advisor**](/power-platform/admin/power-platform-advisor).

### Work queue SLA violation

> [!NOTE]
> Initially, this recommendation will consider all work queue items with past expiry dates for possible SLA violations. However, we will change this logic in a future update to exclude items in a `Processing` or `Processed` state.
