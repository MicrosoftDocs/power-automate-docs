# Azure templates for process mining

Easily onboard your process mining data with process mining templates. Templates help you start mining your processes for insights with just a few selections. You'll avoid the data identification and manipulation that's required with traditional process mining tools. [Azure DevOps (work tracking)](#azure-devops-work-tracking-template), [Azure DevOps (pipelines)](#azure-devops-pipelines-template), [Logic Apps (standard plan)](#logic-apps-standard-plan-template), [Logic Apps (consumption plan)](#logic-apps-consumption-plan-template), and [Durable Functions](#durable-functions-template) templates provide insights that help you identify opportunities and optimize your development processes.

Creating and running a template is similar for all the Azure templates.

## Azure DevOps (work tracking) template

The Azure DevOps (work tracking) template analyzes the execution and handling of tracked Azure DevOps (ADO) work items to help you maximize your development processes and manage dependencies. To learn more, go to [What is Azure DevOps?](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops?)

The Azure DevOps (work tracking) template uses data from your Azure Boards to analyze your work items. You'll need to gather some information from ADO before you can run the template.

### Gather information from ADO Boards

1. In your Azure DevOps environment in the left panel, select **Project settings**. 

1. Select **Boards** > **Team configuration**, and then select the **Area** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-azure-templates/az-boards.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Azure DevOps Project Settings page with organization, project name, and other information highlighted.":::

1. Find the organization name and project name at the top of the Project Settings page. Take note of the area name.

### Create and run the Azure DevOps (work Tracking) template

1. In Power Automate in the left panel, select **Process mining**.

1. In the **Start with a popular template** section, select the **Azure** tab, and then select the **Azure DevOps (work tracking** tile.

1. In the **Process name** field, enter a name for your process.

1. In the **Organization name**, **Project name**, and **Area name** fields, enter the information from ADO.

1. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description of the process.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the **Connect to data source** screen in the **Authentication kind** field, replace "Anonymous" with **Organizational account**.

    If you're signed in, you'll see your credentials. You can switch to a different account if needed. If you're not signed in, select **Sign in** and sign in to your account.

1. Select **Save**.

The process mining capability will analyze your process. It might take a few minutes for the analytics to appear.

## Logic Apps (standard plan) template

The Logic Apps (standard plan) template analyzes the execution of your Logic Apps to help you maximize your automated processes and manage dependencies. To learn more, go to [What is Azure Logic Apps?](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).

The Logic Apps with App (standard plan) template uses telemetry data from [Azure Monitor Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to analyze your apps. You'll need to get an Application ID for your app in an Application Insights resource before you can run the template.

### Get your app's Application Insights Application ID

**If you're not an Azure admin:** Ask your Azure admin to create an Application Insights resource for your app and give you the app's Application ID and the dimensions to enter for Case ID and Activity.

**If you're an Azure admin:**

### Create and run the Logic Apps with App Insights template

1. To deploy a template, you need to create an Application Insights resource. For instructions, go to [Create an Application Insights resource](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource).

1. On the **Azure** tab in the **Start with a popular template** section, select the **Logic Apps (standard plan)** tile.
