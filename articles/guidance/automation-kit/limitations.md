# Limitations and resolutions for issues in the Automation Kit

This article contains some of the limitations in the Automation Kit.

## Limitations and resolutions

### Environment variables aren't editable after you import a solution

**Issue**
You can't update the values for environment variables from within the solution because the solution is **Managed**.

**Resolution**  
Use the following steps to update environment variables.

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select the **Default Solution** and change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

### Environment variables continue to use the old values after a manual change

**Issue**  
When someone changes environment variable values directly within an environment, instead of through an ALM operation like solution import, flows continue to use the previous value.

**Resolution**  
For canvas apps, the new value will be used during the next session (for example, closing the app and then playing it again).

>[!NOTE]
>You must deactivate and then reactivate cloud flows for them to use the updated value.

### Can't meter non-solution aware flows

**Issue**  
At this time, the current solution can't meter any flows that aren't inside a solution.

**Resolution**  
Put all flows that need to be metered inside a solution.

### Cloud flows don't support metering

**Issue**  
Cloud flows must follow a specific naming convention before they're used for metering.

**Resolution**  
All solution-aware cloud flows that you want to be metered must follow a new naming convention that is internally being validated using **RegEx (_AP-[0-9]{9}_[0-9]{3}\\b)**. Here's the expected format.

   [CloudFlowName]_AP-[9digits]_[3digits]

For example, in **MostLikleyTheBest-CLoUdfLoW_AP-000001013_001.**, you can use the last 3 digits advanced scenarios and are typically 001 if you only have one solution per automation project. If you have multiple solutions for a single project, you could increase that number by 1 for each additional solution if you wish to distinguish them.

>[!TIP]
>You can select the disable naming convention button inside the solution manager app to bypass this requirement.

### Unexpected behaviors with the flow exception framework

**Issue**  
Unable to disable or suspend desktop flows.

**Resolution**  
Turn off parent cloud flows if they're configured to allow them to be turned off.

**Issue**  
Flow runs remain in the waiting stage.

**Resolution**  
If you configure your flows to require acknowledgements when they fail, all flow runs remain in a waiting stage until either you acknowledge the email or the flow times out.

### Desktop flows impact analysis sync limitation (No data in app)

**Issue**  
There's a limitation where only new or modified desktop flows will be analyzed and shown in the app.

**Resolution**  
Do any of the following tasks:

- Modify the desktop flow.
- Import the desktop flow (solution).
- Create a new desktop flow.

>[!NOTE]
>You can use a solution to extend the Automation Kit to sync all desktop flows in an environment with the [RPA CLI](https://aka.ms/rpacli).
