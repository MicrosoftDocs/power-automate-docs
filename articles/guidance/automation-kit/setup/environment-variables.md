# Configure automation kit environment variables

In this article, you'll learn how to configure the automation kit environment variables. To get the information for the environment variables, open a new tab.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. In the **Environments** dropdown menu in the title bar, select **satellite**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Azure Key Vault is required only for automation kit satellite release March 2023 or earlier. Starting with the April 2023 release, Azure Key Vault is no longer required as a prerequisite. Environment variables for this are no longer required.

1. On the top right side of the title bar, select **Settings** (the gear icon) > **Developer resources**.

    The information on this panel will be copied to the Key Vault secrets that follow.

## Get the URL path for your Azure Key Vault secrets

The Azure Key Vault secrets are using the environment variable type. These environment variables need to be in the following format.
  
   ```azurecli
   /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{Resource Group Name}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{Key Vault Name}/secrets/{Secret Name}
   ```

To get the format, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/home).

1. Under **Security**, open your Key Vault with the secrets for your app registration.

1. Select the **Secrets** tab. <!--I don't see this tab.-->

1. In the **URL** field, copy the URL.

1. Open Notepad and paste the URL.

1. Remove everything from **https://** to **/resource**.

1. At the end of the URL, enter **/{SecretName}**.

1. Replace **{secretname}** with your **secret name**.

1. Repeat step 6 through 8 for all three Azure Key Vault secrets (Client ID, Client Secret, Tenant ID).

    Use the following example as a guide. These reference strings are needed for three environment variables.

## Environment variable summary

   Use the information in the following table for the environment variables.
