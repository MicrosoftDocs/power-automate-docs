# Feedback and support

Although the underlying features and components used to build the Automation Kit (such as Microsoft Dataverse, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community can use and customize these features to support an Automation CoE in their organizations.

If you face issues with:

- **Using the kit** 
  - Report your issue to [aka.ms/automation-kit-issues](https://aka.ms/automation-kit-issues). (Microsoft Support isn't able to assist with issues related to the Automation Kit, but they're able to help with related, underlying platform and feature issues.)
    
- **The core features in Microsoft Power Platform, Power Automate, or Power Apps**
  - Use your standard channel to contact Microsoft Support.
