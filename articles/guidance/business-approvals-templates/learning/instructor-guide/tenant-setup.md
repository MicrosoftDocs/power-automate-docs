# Tenant Setup

Welcome to the Tenant Setup section of the Power Platform Approvals Kit instructor guide. Tenant setup covers the various options available for setting up a tenant to host the Approvals Kit. With a range of choices available, it's important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of each option to ensure your organization is set up for success. If your organization already has a tenant set up, then you're able to skip the section.

If using a tenant isn't an option, such as when you can create a standalone demonstration tenant for learners. We explore other options such as Office 365 Development Environments or creating a new Microsoft Entra ID tenant. Let's dive in and explore the various options available for setting up your tenant to host the Approvals Kit.

## Options

The following table outlines possible options for tenant selection

## Summary

The options provided a high-level overview of the various options available for setting up a tenant to host the Approvals Kit. It's important to note that each option has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the best choice depends on the specific needs of your organization. However, if your organization already has an existing tenant with available licenses then it can provide the most long-term path for building a community of learners and scaling knowledge. By using an existing tenant, you can bring in cohorts of learners over time and take advantage of the Approvals Kit without incurring extra costs or administrative overhead.
