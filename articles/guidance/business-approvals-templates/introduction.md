Business approvals templates as part of the approvals kit provide no-code templates that are built on top of Microsoft Power Platform components. Use these templates to accelerate the speed at which your organization creates sophisticated approvals workflows that include conditional branching, delegation, administrative overrides, and more. Since the templates are no-code, almost anyone in your organization can use them to meet your approval needs.

Organizations often need approvals for key business processes. These processes might include expense reporting, time sheet management, business travel requests, procurement orders and sales discounts.

With Power Platform, you can automate approvals needs by combining components from [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com) and [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com). As the complexity of your approvals increases, so does your configuration and need to assemble multiple low code components together. The business approvals templates are available with as a configured collection of components and tools that are designed to help organizations automate their approvals processes quickly.

These templates cover many of the typical requirements in most organizations, such as the ability to:

- Configure multi-stage approvals
- Delegate others to approve
- View approvals progress and history
- Manage out of office for approvers
- Support for versions of approval process
- Publish version approval workflow
- Handle of work days and public holidays

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on your role in the organization, you may need an assigned Microsoft 365 license and a Premium Power Platform license to design, store, and run the cloud services related to the business approvals template. Refer to the [setup guide](./setup.md) for specific license requirements.
