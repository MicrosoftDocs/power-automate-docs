# User Journey

In the content below we'll explore an end-to-end user journey using the business approvals templates kit.

Charlotte is a business user who wants to make approvals with several considerations:

| Scenario | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| SAP invoices | When SAP invoices are submitted based on data inside the invoice a manual approval is required. |
| Manager approvals | Manager approval is required for SAP invoices above the line manager approval limits. |
| Approver availability | Depending on where the approver is in the world there are different holiday schedules or working schedules. Waiting for approvals can cause delays until an approver returns. |
| Handling holidays | Approvers may be on holiday when a request is submitted. In this case there could be delays in processing the approval request or confusion on who is an alternate approver. |
| Power Platform permissions | Charlotte has limited permissions to build and deploy approvals solutions to test and production environments. |
| COE team support | Charlotte works with Gibson as her technical contact and mentor to help install solutions and create low-code Power Platform solutions. |

Charlotte evaluates these considerations and chooses to use the business approval kit because it provides support for multi level approvals and handling for different approver scenarios. Working with Gibson from the Center of Excellence team, Charlotte installs the business approvals kit in an environment. Once the kit is installed, Charlotte models the approval process. Because SAP Power Automate is a newer area for Charlotte, she works with Gibson to build the required triggers to obtain the SAP data and trigger the approval workflow. Approvals are generated by using the workflow and Power Automate Cloud flow for approvers to accept and decline requests.

## Experience

### Install

Gibson reviews the [Setup Guide](./setup.md) to ensure the prerequisites are in place. Using [System administrator](/power-platform/admin/database-security#environments-with-a-dataverse-database) or [System customizer](/power-platform/admin/database-security#environments-with-a-dataverse-database) permissions, the approvals kit can be installed into an environment and provide access for Approvals Administrators to access the application.

### Configure the business approval process

Charlotte uses the Process Designer to create a new business approval workflow and define approval stages, conditions, and approval steps within each stage that match the business requirements within the Sales department.

More information: [Configure preset approvals](./configure-preset-approvals.md)

### Approval triggers

Gibson, another maker, or professional developers within organization can easily integrate their existing solutions and IT systems. Triggers can include connections such as SQL server, Azure Functions. These individuals can start the approvals process by adding a new cloud flow or modifying existing cloud flow actions.

The rest of the approval processes are automatically handled and managed in the approvals kit.

More information: [Trigger approvals](./trigger-approvals.md)

### Integration with business applications

Common approval scenarios require integrations with business applications such as SAP and Dynamics 365, etc. Native connectors are available to integrate with these services.

#### Integration with RPA

Use desktop flows to streamline your approval processes with legacy systems, automating your approval experiences in a modern way.

### Process approval requests

Rebecca and other configured approvers receive messages as adaptive cards in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams. These approvals include details provided by the business approval designer, Charlotte, to determine if the request should be approved or declined.
