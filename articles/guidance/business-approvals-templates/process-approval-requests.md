## Approvals status reference

The Business Approval Management app uses icons as a visual guide to approval status.

|Icon|Status|Description|
|----|------|-----------|
|:::image type="content" source="media/approval-request-approved.png" alt-text="Icon for Approval request approve.":::|Approve|Approves the request. Approvals Kit will automatically request the next approval for approval, or will complete the approval with status set to Approved.|
|:::image type="content" source="media/approval-request-approved-with-condition.png" alt-text="Icon for Request approve with condition.":::|Approve with condition|Approves the request with condition. Approvals Kit will automatically request the next approval for approval, or will complete the approval with status set to Approved with condition.|
|:::image type="content" source="media/approval-request-reject.png" alt-text="Icon for Approval request reject.":::|Reject|Declines the request. The Approvals Kit automatically terminates the approval request, and sets the approval statues to Declined|
|:::image type="content" source="media/approval-request-send-back.png" alt-text="Icon for Approval request send back.":::|Send back|Sends back the request to the previous approver. Approvals Kit sets the current approval request status back to Not Started, and look up the previous approval request to override existing result to Pending again for the previous approval to look at the request again. If two or more requests occur in the previous step simultaneously, all of the previous steps are processed in the same way.|
||Reassign|Reassigns the approval request to whoever you specify. Approval request remains to be Pending|

In addition to your decisions, there are also three other statuses that can be shown in the approval status.
