## (Optional) Set up a new environment to install

1. Create an environment in which to set up the approvals kit.

    a.  Go to the Power Platform admin center.

    b.  Select **Environments**, then **+ New** and enter a name, type, and purpose.

    c.  Select **Yes** to create the database, and then choose**Next**.

    d.  Ensure **Sample apps and data set** is set to **No**.

    e.  Select **Save**.

1. Go to [your new environment](https://make.powerapps.com) to import the Approvals Kit solution for a manual install.

## Enable Power Automate approvals capability

The approvals kit relies on out of the box approvals functionality from Power Automate. If you're using the approvals function for the first time, you must enable the function first either by using the Power Platform Command Line interface or manually by running a cloud flow that includes an approval

### Command line setup

Use Power Platform Command Line to install the flow approvals solution into the environment. In the environment allocated for the Approvals Kit, use the following PowerShell commands as a starter script:

```pwsh
$envs = (pac admin list --json | ConvertFrom-Json) | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -eq "Your Environment Name"  }
pac application install --environment $envs[0].EnvironmentId --application-name "msdyn_FlowApprovals"
```

### Manual Setup

In new environments, use the Power Platform Admin Center to install the Power Automate Approvals feature:

1. Open the [Power Platform Admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

1. In the left navigation, select **Resources**.

1. Select **Dynamics 365 apps**.

1. From the list, select **Microsoft Flow Approvals**.

1. Select the **...** menu for Microsoft Flow Approvals.

1. Select **Install**.

1. Select the environment that the Approvals Kit will be installed in.

1. Review the terms of service.

1. Agree to the terms of service and select **Install**.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 10 minutes to install.

## Install the core components

We recommend that you set up a designated Approvals Kit environment for all users within your organization who need to access the Business Approvals process. Further information on environments is available in [environments overview](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview). If you're a business user, you'll typically need a person with administrative access to Power Platform to create an environment for you. Reach out to your IT department to ask for assistance on environment setup.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The Approvals Kit uses [solution management capabilities](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/introduction-solutions) of Dataverse to package up all assets.
> - To ensure consistency and same experience for every customer, the template is provided as [managed solutions](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm).
> - If you would like to extend the template, you will need to use a separate [unmanaged solution](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm) because you can't directly modify this template.

### Import the Creator Kit

Install the creator kit using one of the options in [Install the Creator Kit](/power-platform/guidance/creator-kit/setup).

### Import the solution

Using an account with System Customizer permissions in an environment. Open [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com). Go to the environment you either created or been allocated, in which the Approvals Kit should be hosted.

The first step of the installation process is to install the solution. This step is required for every other component in the Approvals Kit to work. You'll either need to create an environment or to import into the existing environment (excluding the Default environment).

1. Open [the Power CAT business approvals kit GitHub release site](https://github.com/microsoft/powercat-business-approvals-kit/releases).

1. From the expanded section **Assets** for the latest release, download the Approvals Kit file **BusinessApprovalsKit_*_managed.zip**.

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.

1. Select **Import**, then choose **Browse**.

1. Select the Approvals Kit core components solution from File Explorer.

1. Once the compressed (.zip) value is available, select **Next**.

1. Review the information, and then select **Next**.

1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If the connections don't exist, create new connections to proceed with import.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**.

### After import steps

#### Update custom connector

1. Select **App Registration** from the Application section under **Identity**.
1. Select New registration and provide a name, then select **Register**.
1. Under **API permission**, select **Add a permission** and choose **Dynamic CRM**.

    - Select Authentication type as **OAuth 2.0**.
    - Enter the Client ID
    - Enter the Secret noted in previous section.
    - Specify the environment URL under Resource URL section. This Resource url contains the link to your environment. This is in format https://yourenv.crm[x].dynamics.com where [x] is optional depending on your region

1. Copy the Redirect URL.
1. Open the created Entra App Registration.
1. Select **Authentication**.
1. In the Web Redirect URIs, add the Redirect URL.
1. Select **Save** to update the App Registration.
1. Switch back to the custom connector.

    - Edit the **Custom connector** again and test the **GetPublishedWorkflow** operation.

The operation should run successfully with status as 200.

  > [!NOTE]
  > - Not sure on your region? You can review /power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions
  > - You can obtain you environment url from https://aka.ms/ppac environments or the Power Apps Portal in the settings of the environment.
