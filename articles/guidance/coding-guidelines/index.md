# Power Automate coding guidelines

No matter how simple or complex a Power Automate cloud flow is, maintaining quality is critical as the flow's complexity grows.

These coding guidelines provide standards for naming actions, variables, and connectors, along with best practices for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable flows. They offer essential guidance for developers who design, build, test, deploy, and maintain Power Automate flows in various environments, including small businesses, corporations, and government entities.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [Power CAT Toolkit](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/microsoftpowercatarch.powercattools?tab=Overview) to perform code reviews. The toolkit incorporates many of the coding guidelines from this documentation, ensuring that your solutions are efficient and maintainable. The toolkit automatically flags any patterns that don't adhere to these best practices, allowing you to address potential issues early in the development process. This proactive approach not only enhances the quality of your code but also helps streamline the review process, making it easier to maintain high standards across your projects. Integrating the Power CAT Toolkit into your development workflow ensures that your solutions are built on a solid foundation and leads to more reliable and scalable solutions.
