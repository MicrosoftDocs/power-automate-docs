# Manage cloud flow behaviour with Flow Checker

The flow checker in Microsoft Power Automate is a built-in tool designed to help users ensure the quality and correctness of their cloud flows. It provides real-time analysis and feedback on potential issues, helping to improve the reliability and functionality of the flows. This tool is essential for both new and experienced users, as it enhances the development process by providing actionable insights.

Here's how Flow Checker can help makers:

- **Error detection**: The Flow Checker identifies errors that prevent the flow from running, such as missing or incorrect inputs, misconfigured actions, and connectivity issues.

- **Warnings and suggestions**: It also provides warnings and best practice suggestions to optimize the flow's performance and maintainability. These might include recommendations for improving logic or identifying deprecated actions.

- **Real-time feedback**: As you build or modify your flow, the Flow Checker provides real-time feedback, allowing you to address issues immediately.

- **Detailed explanations**: Each error or warning comes with a detailed explanation and guidance on how to resolve the issue, making it easier for users to understand and fix problems.
