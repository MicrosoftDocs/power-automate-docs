# Prevent data exfiltration

By implementing data loss prevention (DLP) policies, configuring IP firewalls, and setting up tenant isolation, you guard against unauthorized access to data and enhance the security of your Power Platform resources. 

## Use data loss prevention policies

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a security solution that identifies and helps prevent unsafe or inappropriate sharing, transfer, or use of sensitive data.

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies help manage and control data sharing and movement across Power Apps, Power Automate, and other Power Platform components. These policies help organizations prevent data loss and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

DLP best practices to consider include:

- Blocking/isolating non-business connectors, especially in default environments.
- Blocking high risk operations such as HTTP, HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID and SharePoint URLs in environments with many makers.
- Using endpoint filtering to make sure only expected endpoints can be reached.

## Configure IP firewall in Power Platform environments

Environment admins can configure a set or range of IP addresses that are allowed to interact with Power Platform resources. Configuring IP firewalls ensures that only requests from specified IP addresses can trigger a workflow.

- Set up IP restrictions in your Power Platform environment.
- Define the allowed IP addresses or ranges that can access the HTTP request trigger.

## Configure tenant isolation

Power Platform has a rich ecosystem of connectors based on Microsoft Entra that allow authorized Microsoft Entra users to build compelling apps and flows establishing connections to the business data available through these data stores. 

Tenant isolation makes it easy for administrators to ensure that these connectors can be used in a secure way within the tenant while minimizing the risk of data exfiltration outside the tenant. Tenant isolation allows Power Platform administrators to effectively govern the movement of tenant data from Microsoft Entra authorized data sources to and from their tenant.

## Configure Microsoft Entra conditional access policies

Power Automate conditional access policies can be created in addition to DLP, HTTP OAuth, and IP-pinning to prevent data exfiltration.

The minimum audience to include in conditional access policies include:

| Audience | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Your unique Dataverse org audience | For example, `https://{your-org}.crm.dynamics.com`/ |
| Power Platform | `https://api.powerplatform.com` |
| Power Automate | `https://service.flow.microsoft.com/` |
| Power Apps | `https://service.powerapps.com/` |
| Connections | `https://apihub.azure.com` |
