# Use code view, add notes, and copy&paste action

## Peek code/Code View

**Peek code or Code view** is a feature that allows users to view the underlying JSON representation of the actions and triggers within a flow. This feature is particularly useful for advanced users who want to understand the exact structure and configuration of their flows, troubleshoot issues, or manually edit specific details that are not easily accessible through the standard visual interface. 

In the new designer use Code view to view trigger/action code

## Copy Paste actions

Copy paste of actions is a useful way to reuse the same action multiple times within a flow or across different flows. This helps in simplifying the process of creating and modifying flows and saves time and multiple clicks.
