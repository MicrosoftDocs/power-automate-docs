# Keep flow configuration generic

By using environment variables and service principals, you can avoid exposing sensitive information and streamline the administration of your flows.

## Environment variables

When you export a Power Automate flow via a solution or as a zip package, it's easy to expose hard-coded values like passwords or secrets by opening the flow definition. To prevent exposing sensitive information, use [environment variables](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables-power-automate). Environment variables let you manage these sensitive values securely and change them without modifying the flow itself.

## Service principals

A service principal is a nonhuman security identity that represents an application or service capable of owning and managing resources within Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power Platform. 

To use a service principal in Power Platform, you need to create a service principal application user. You can create a service principal application user through the portal or through the API. An application user can have connections shared with them and can own resources such as flows.

Whenever possible, use service principals for flow ownership and creating connections. This approach enhances security and simplifies management. Learn more: [Support for service principal owned flows](/power-automate/service-principal-support).
