# Get feedback on your flows with Flow Checker

Flow Checker is a built-in tool in Power Automate that's designed to help you ensure the quality and correctness of your cloud flows by providing real-time analysis and feedback on potential issues. It's essential for maintaining the reliability and performance of your automations.

## Key benefits of Flow Checker

**Error detection**: Flow Checker identifies errors that prevent the flow from running, such as missing or incorrect inputs, misconfigured actions, and connectivity issues.

**Warnings and suggestions**: Flow Checker provides warnings and best practice suggestions to optimize the flow's performance and maintainability. Recommendations might include improving logic, updating deprecated actions, or enhancing the flow's overall efficiency.

**Real-time feedback**: Flow Checker offers feedback in real time as you build or modify a flow. This immediate insight allows you to address issues as they arise for a smoother development process.

**Detailed explanations**: Each error and warning includes a detailed explanation and guidance on how to resolve it. The extra detail makes it easier to understand and fix the problem.
