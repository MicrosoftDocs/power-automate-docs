# Making phase

You have now planned and designed how you'd like to automate your process.
The next step is to set up the automation.

## Basic steps for cloud flows

1.  Create a cloud flow in [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

2. Specify an event or trigger to start the flow with
    [connectors](/connectors/). Based on the way you
    want to trigger the automation, you'll specify what event you want to use
    to trigger your Power Automate flow.

3.  [Add actions](../../multi-step-logic-flow.md) and [conditions](../../add-condition.md).

More information: [Overview of cloud flows](../../overview-cloud.md), [Create a flow from a template in Power Automate](../../get-started-logic-template.md)

## Basic steps for desktop flows

1. Create a new desktop flow in [Power Automate Desktop](../../desktop-flows/introduction.md).

1. Add actions and set up configuration.

1. Define inputs and outputs.

1. Test the desktop flow you created.

1. If needed, set up triggers and links between cloud flows and Power Automate Desktop.
