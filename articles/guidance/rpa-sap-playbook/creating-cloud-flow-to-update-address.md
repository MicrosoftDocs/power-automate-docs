# Create the cloud flow to update an address with Power Automate 
<!--note from editor: Suggest making the title more specific, otherwise they begin to run together I think.-->
Now, we'll create the cloud flow that employees use to request an updated address. This cloud flow passes the input variables to the desktop flow you created in the previous section.<!--note from editor: Not sure if this reference is good enough or should it be a link.-->

We highly recommended that you create cloud flows, desktop flows and other Microsoft Power Platform artifacts within solutions to allow for better portability, application lifecycle management (ALM), and encapsulation.

1. Navigate to <https://make.powerautomate.com> and sign in with your Microsoft Entra credentials.

2. Confirm that you're in the same environment as the one in which you built the desktop flow with Power Automate Desktop, and then select **Solutions** > **+ New solution**.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Automate portal window with Solutions selected on the left pane and the New solution button selected.](media/power-automate-portal-with-new-solution-button.png)

3. Enter a **Display name**, select a **Publisher**, and then select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot of the New Solution dialog.](media/new-solution-dialog.png)

4. Open the solution by selecting its name.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Automate Solutions list with the new solution selected.](media/solutions-list-with-RPA-SAP-solution.png)

5. Select **+ Add existing**, select **Desktop flow**, select the flow you created in Power Automate Desktop, and then select **Add**.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Automate Solutions area with the RPA SAP Address Solution showing the SAP RPA Playbook Demo flow in the list.](media/SAP-RPA-playbook-demo-UI-flow-in-solution-list.png)

6. Select **+ New** > **Cloud flow**.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Automate solution screen with Cloud flow selected in the New menu.](media/power-automate-solution-screen-with-cloud-flow-in-new-menu.png)

7. Give your flow a name, and select **Manually trigger a flow** as the trigger.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Automate flow designer with the Manually trigger a flow trigger being added.](media/power-automate-flow-designer-with-manually-trigger-a-flow.png)

8. Select **+ Add an input**, and then select the appropriate data type to create the eight inputs listed in step 9.

   ![Screenshot of the Manually trigger a flow dialog with the Add an input button.](media/manually-trigger-a-flow-add-input-button.png)

   ![Screenshot of the Manually trigger a flow dialog with Choose the type of user input selection area.](media/manually-trigger-a-flow-choose-user-input.png)

   ![Screenshot of the Manually trigger a flow dialog with AddressType added as Text type.](media/manually-trigger-a-flow-with-addresstype.png)

9. Add the following inputs to the flow trigger.

10. Select **New step**.

    ![Screenshot of the Power Automate flow designer with the New Step button under the trigger box.](media/power-automate-flow-designer-with-new-step-button.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >The following Azure Key Vault action configurations are optional, so if you aren't using Key Vault today, or you just want to test your desktop flow without it, feel free to skip them.<!--note from editor: I assume the reader wouldn't just stop here if they didn't want to configure Key Vault - which step should they skip to? It would be much clearer to have the first 10 steps end  the next set of steps their own heading, something like **To configure Azure Key Vault actions (optional)**. I'm not sure where the main procedure resumes, so I can't suggest where that would go.-->

11. Enter **azure key vault** into the search box.

    ![Screenshot of selecting the Azure Key Vault Get secret action in the Power Automate flow designer.](media/selecting-Azure-Key-Vault-get-secret-action.png)

12. If you don't have an existing Key Vault connection, you'll be prompted to create one. You can sign in either with a Microsoft Entra user account or a Service Principal (recommended).

    ![Screenshot of an Azure Key Vault action in the Power Automate flow designer.](media/selecting-Azure-Key-Vault-action-in-flow-designer.png)

13. Let's assume you select **Connect with Service Principal**.

    ![Screenshot of establishing a connection using the Azure Key Vault action in Power Automate flow designer after signing in.](media/establishing-connection-using-Azure-Key-Vault-action.png)

14. After you establish the connection, add four **Get secret** Key Vault actions to the canvas, select the secret, and then rename the actions as shown in the following image.

    :::image type="complex" source="media/add-4-get-secret-Azure-Key-Vault-actions.png" alt-text="Add Get secret actions to the canvas.":::
    Screenshot showing four actions: Get SAP System Id, renamed SAP-HCM-SystemId; Get SAP Client, renamed SAP-HCM-Client; Get SAP User, renamed SAPUser; and Get SAP Password, renamed SAPPassword.
    :::image-end:::

15. Select **More** (**…**) next to the action name, select **Settings**, turn on **Secure Inputs** and **Secure Outputs**, and then select **Done**. Repeat this step for the other three **Get secret** actions.

    ![Screenshot of Secure Inputs and Secure Outputs turned on in the settings for the Get SAP System Id secret.](media/secure-inputs-secure-outputs-settings-in-get-secret.png)

16. Select the plus sign **(+)**, and then select **Add an action**.

    ![Screenshot of adding an action under the Manually trigger a flow trigger.](media/adding-an-action.png)

17. Enter **scope** into the search box, and then select the **Scope** action.

    ![Screenshot of searching for Scope actions.](media/searching-for-scope-actions.png)

18. Drag all your Key Vault actions onto the **Scope** container, and then rename it to **Try**.<!--note from editor: In the second screenshot, I think the name should be **Try** just to show that this step has been completed. -->

    ![Screenshot of dragging the Get secret actions to the Scope container.](media/dragging-get-secret-to-scope-box.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Scope container with all the Get secret actions in it.](media/scope-box-with-get-secret-actions.png)

19. Search for, and then select, the **initialize variable** action to add it under the trigger.

    - For **Name**, enter **Bot failed**.
    - For **Type**, select **Boolean**.
    - For **Value**, enter **false**.

    ![Screenshot of the Initialize variable and Expression dialogs.](media/initialize-variable-box-and-expression-pop-out.png)

21. Add two scope actions. Name them **Catch** and **Finally**.

    ![Screenshot of Try, Catch, and Finally scope containers.](media/try-catch-finally-scope-box.png)

22. In the upper-right corner of the **Catch** scope, select **…**, and then select **Configure run after**.

    ![Screenshot of the Catch scope with Configure run after selected in the More menu.](media/catch-scope-box-with-configure-run-after.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Finally should run after dialog.](media/run-after-setup-for-finally-box.png)

25. Search for, and then add, the **set variable** action to the **Catch** scope container.<!--note from editor: Edit okay? -->

    ![Screenshot of the Catch scope with the Set variable action being added.](media/catch-scope-box-with-set-variable-action.png)

26. Select the **Bot failed** variable, enter **true** in the **Expression** dialog, and then select **OK**.

    ![Screenshot of the Set variable action and Expression dialogs.](media/set-variable-box-with-expression-pop-out.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Set variable action with Name equal to Bot failed and Value equal to the expression true.](media/set-variable-box-with-name-bot-failed-and-value-true.png)

27. Search for the **condition** action, and then add it to the **Finally** block.

    ![Screenshot of the Finally scope with a condition action being added.](media/finally-scope-box-with-condition-action.png)

28. Select the **Bot failed** variable from the **Dynamic content** list and then assign it to the **Choose a value** field.

    ![Screenshot of the Finally scope with Condition action and Dynamic expression dialogs.](media/finally-scope-box-with-condition-action-and-dynamic-expression.png)

29. Set the expression to **false**, and then assign it to the **value** field.

    ![Screenshot of the Condition segment with Dynamic content dialog to set the phrase Bot failed equal to false.](media/condition-segment-with-bot-failed-false.png)

30. In the **If yes** section, add a **Send an email (V2)** action.

    ![Screenshot of the If yes condition with Send an email action being added.](media/if-yes-condition-with-send-email-action.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Run a flow built by Power Automate Desktop dialog with the system ID being added from dynamic content.](media/run-a-UI-flow-built-by-PAD-with-system-ID.png)

36. Check the expected date time format in SAP and make adjustments if needed by using the formatDateTime function. For example, use **formatDateTime(triggerBody()\['date'\],'dd.MM.yyyy')** to get a date formatted day-month-year, as in the German-formatted date of 13.10.2020.

    ![Screenshot of the Run a flow built by Power Automate Desktop dialog with the date format being set from the Expressions dialog.](media/run-a-UI-flow-built-by-PAD-with-date-format-being-set.png)

    ![Screenshot of the Run a flow built by Power Automate Desktop dialog with the date format expression.](media/run-a-UI-flow-built-by-PAD-with-date-format-set.png)

37. Supply the data for all other fields by selecting the appropriate property from the trigger **Dynamic content** list for the cloud flow.
