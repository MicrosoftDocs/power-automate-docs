# Sharing and connectors admin analytics reports

Organizations need insights into how apps are used and who's using them. The Admin analytics sharing and connectors reports provide insights into how Power Automate is being used within your tenant. 

Use the shared flows report to learn who your app champions are and then empower them to provide even more automated solutions for your organization. The connectors report identifies Microsoft, third-party, and custom connectors that are in use within your organization.
