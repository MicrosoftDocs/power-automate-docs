# Create flows to manage email

There are four ways to create flows to manage your email:<!--note from editor: There is no order here.-->

- Use a template&mdash;Most likely, there's already a [template](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/templates) accomplishes your scenario. Search for your scenario among the templates and then follow the steps to create a cloud flow from the template.

- Tweak a template&mdash;If you find a template that is similar to your scenario, but it doesn’t do exactly what you are want, you can create a cloud flow from that template and then tweak the flow to your liking. You can extend a cloud flow that's created from template by adding, editing, or removing, triggers and actions. 


   <!--Todo use a link in the docs, not a blog-->
   >[!TIP]
   >You can [copy and paste](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-clipboard-in-flow-designer-and-three-new-user-experience-updates/) actions in the same flow or across flows to speed up the process.

- Create a cloud flow from scratch&mdash;If you can't find a template that's similar to your scenario, you can [create a cloud flow from scratch](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow) and then connect the services you want.

- Create a cloud flow from a connector&mdash;In Power Automate, select **Connectors** from the left side of the screen, search for the connector you want, and then select it to create your flow. For example, search for "outlook" to find connectors for Office 365 Outlook.
