# Create flows to manage email

Here are some of the most frequently used ways to create flows to manage your email.

 Power Automate offers many templates for you to create flows. You can use these templates "as is" or you can make any adjustments that your scenario needs. If you don't find a template that matches your scenario, you can create a cloud flow without a template. You can also create a flow from connectors.

1. **Use a template:** Most likely, there's already a [template](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/) that accomplishes your scenario. Search for your scenario among the templates, and then follow the steps to create a cloud flow from the template.
 
1. **Tweak a template:** If you find a template that's similar to your scenario, but it doesn't do exactly what you want, you can create a cloud flow from that template and then tweak the flow to your liking. You can extend a cloud flow that you created from a template by adding, editing, or removing triggers and actions.

    >[!TIP]
    >You can [copy and paste](./multi-step-logic-flow.md#copy-and-paste-actions) actions in the same flow or across flows to speed up the process. <!--Todo use a link in the docs, not a blog-->

1. **Create a cloud flow from scratch:** If you can't find a template that's similar to your scenario, you can [create a cloud flow from scratch](./get-started-logic-flow.md) and then connect the services you want.

1. **Create a cloud flow from a connector:** In Power Automate, select **Connectors** from the left side of the screen, search for the connector you want, and then select it to create your flow. For example, search for **outlook** to find connectors for Outlook for Microsoft 365.
