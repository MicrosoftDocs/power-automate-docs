# Overview of process advisor

Process advisor quickly captures detailed steps for each process in your organization to help you better understand places to streamline workflows. You can do this on your own or invite colleagues to contribute and collaborate.

Process advisor helps you to:

- Gain insights about which parts of your processes would be best to automate.
- Identify which activities take the most time.
- Discover which activities are repeated the most.
- Improve efficiencies by understanding where the bottlenecks are.

## Business example

For example, in a healthcare facility, you can use process advisor to record patient check-in procedures. Process advisor automatically produces a process map that visualizes the check-in process. You can see which activities take the longest, how many variations of the check-in process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time.

Application analytics and analytics dashboards show you which applications teams spend the most time in, and the best activities to optimize. You're then guided to create cloud flows with automation recommendations that reveal which connectors to use based on your workflows.

With insights and guided recommendations from process advisor, you're ready to begin automating, and reclaim the time you need for what matters most.
