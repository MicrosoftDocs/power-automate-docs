# Overview of process advisor

 The process advisor feature allows you to gain a better understanding of your business processes so you can optimize them. It can also help you improve how you work by finding opportunities for automation. Process advisor offers *task mining* and *process mining* capabilities to do this.

Task mining and process mining share the same goal of improving process efficiency. The main difference is their area of focus:

- **Task mining:** Enables you to understand how your company performs its process tasks through monitoring recorded user actions and collecting data from these actions. You'll gain insights from this data that will let you know how processes are performed, find common mistakes while performing tasks, and identify tasks that can be automated.

- **Process mining:** Enables you to gain a deep understanding of your processes using event log files that you can get from your system of record (apps you use in your processes). Process mining displays maps of your processes with data and metrics to recognize performance issues.

## When to use task mining or process mining

Here are some reasons to help you decide to use task mining or process mining:

### Use task mining to:

- Understand what employees actually do while performing each task.

- Identify and eliminate unnecessary actions in process tasks.

- Identify the most common actions through user interactions.

- Automate tasks that would accelerate processes and reduce human errors.


### Use process mining to:

- See the actual steps to perform a process.

- Improve processes.

- Detect non-compliant processes.

- Reduce process total time.

- Discover automation opportunities.
