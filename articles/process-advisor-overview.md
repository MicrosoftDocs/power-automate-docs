# Overview of process advisor (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## What is process advisor?

Process advisor records and analyzes your manual business tasks. It discovers inefficiencies and shows optimization and automation opportunities. For example: in a healthcare facility, you could use process advisor to record patient check-in procedures. process advisor automatically produces a process map that visualizes the check in process. You can see which activities take the longest, how many variations of the check-in process there are, and what variations and actions take the most time. Using this information and the powerful features in process advisor, you can drive improvements to make a difference for business.
