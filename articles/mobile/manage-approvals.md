# Manage approvals

Manage your approval requests on your mobile device when you're away from your desk.

You can quickly approve or reject approval requests in the Power Automate mobile app, right from the **Approvals** screen.

1. In the Power Automate mobile app, select **Approvals**, and then select the arrow to expand a request.

1. Select **Approve** or **Reject**.

If you want more information about a request before you approve or reject it, you can view any comments and attachments on a separate screen.

1. On the **Approvals** screen, select the vertical ellipsis (&vellip;) next to a request, and then select **Details**.

1. Select **Approve** or **Reject**.

When the **Approval submitted successfully** or **Rejection submitted successfully** message appears at the top of the screen, your approval or rejection is complete:

## Create custom responses

You can also create your own responses to approval requests. For example, you might want to respond with **Need more info** before you either **Accept** or **Reject** a request. [Learn how to create custom responses](../create-approval-response-options.md).
