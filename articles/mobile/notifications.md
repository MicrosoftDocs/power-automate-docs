# Receive notifications

The Power Automate mobile app allows you to receive notifications on your mobile device. You'll get a notification whenever you run a flow that uses either the Microsoft [Notifications](/connectors/flowpush/) connector or the [Approvals](/connectors/approvals/) connector. You'll also get a notification when a flow encounters a run error.

The list of notifications you've received was previously called Activity Feed.

To view all notifications that correspond to your flows, select the bell icon at the top of the screen.

Notifications that arrived since the last time you opened the app appear in the **New** list. Other notifications appear in the **Older** list.

A timestamp indicates how long ago the notification arrived. For instance, **5 m** means the notification arrived five minutes ago. Notifications are removed from the **Older** list after 14 days.

The **Notifications** screen shows notifications from the current environment only. To view notifications from a different environment, [select the environment](overview-mobile.md#change-environments).

## Filter your notifications

By default, the **Notifications** screen shows all the notifications you've received.

To show only notifications that are related to push notifications sent from a flow, select **From flows** at the top of the **Notifications** screen.

To show only notifications of errors that occurred when a flow ran, select **Run status** at the top of the **Notifications** screen.
