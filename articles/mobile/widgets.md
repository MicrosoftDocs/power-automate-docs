# Create widgets for flows

For quick and easy access to your flows, create a widget. Widgets make running flows effortless. You can run a flow from the home screen of your mobile device, without having to open the Power Automate app.

If your flow requires you to enter information, the widget will open the flow in the app. The flow will continue after you fill in the information.

Widgets can only run flows that you created. They can't run flows that have been shared with you. However, you can run [solution-aware flows](../overview-solution-flows.md) using a widget.

## Create a widget on an iOS device

The widget will show only the top eight (8) flows on an iOS device.

1. Long-press the home screen where you want to place the widget and select the plus icon (**+**).
1. Select the Power Automate app.

    If you aren't signed in to the app, it will open to allow you to sign in.

1. Select **Add a widget**.
