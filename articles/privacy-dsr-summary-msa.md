# Respond to personal data requests (Microsoft account)

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-intro](~/../shared-content/shared/privacy-includes/gdpr-intro.md)]

 Power Automate provides tools and resources to help you respond to requests to correct, export, or delete personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud. This article helps you respond to requests from users who authenticate using a Microsoft account. [Respond to requests from users who authenticate using Microsoft Entra ID](privacy-dsr-summary.md).

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft account with a [free Power Automate license](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/)

## Respond to requests

Requests from data subjects require one or more of the following actions, depending on the request:

1. [**Discover:**](privacy-dsr-discovery-msa.md) Use search and discovery tools to find the user's personal data, including accounts and system-generated logs. Determine whether the request meets your organization's guidelines for responding to personal data requests.

1. **Access:** Retrieve personal data that resides in the Microsoft cloud.

1. **Correct:** Make changes to personal data as requested, if appropriate.

    As a data processor, Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to edit system-generated logs. These logs reflect factual activities and constitute a history of all events within a service. [Learn more about system-generated logs in Power Automate](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-gdpr-dsr-guide-systemlogs).

1. **Restrict:** Restrict the processing of personal data, either by removing licenses for various services or turning off the services where possible. You can also remove data from the Microsoft cloud and retain it on-premises or at another location.

1. [**Delete:**](privacy-dsr-delete-msa.md) Permanently remove personal data that resides in Microsoft's cloud. [Learn more about closing a Microsoft account](privacy-dsr-accountclose-msa.md).

1. [**Export:**](privacy-dsr-export-msa.md) Provide an electronic copy of personal data in a machine-readable format to the data subject.
