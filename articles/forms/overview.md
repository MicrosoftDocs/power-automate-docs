## Microsoft Forms trigger
A trigger is the event that starts the flow. For example, Here is the full list of the Microsoft Forms triggers.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Forms trigger screen.](..\media\forms\forms-trigger.png "Screen showing the forms trigger in Power Automate")

## Microsoft Forms action
Actions are the events you want the workflow to do once the trigger takes place. Here is the full list of the Forms actions. The trigger doesn’t contain dynamic content that includes all of the responses, so you always need to use When a new response is identified with Get response details.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Forms action screen.](..\media\forms\forms-action.png "Screen showing the forms action in Power Automate")
