# Get started using flows with Microsoft Forms

The easiest way to add a form to a flow is to start with a template. [Search the template gallery](https://make.powerautomate.com/templates/) for "Microsoft Forms," or browse by category, to find a template that meets your needs. Follow the steps in the template to create your flow.

If you find a template that's similar to what you want to do but it isn't exactly right for your scenario, you can still create a flow from the template and then customize it. You can add, edit, and remove triggers and actions. You can even [copy and paste actions](/power-automate/multi-step-logic-flow#copy-and-paste-actions) in the same flow or across flows to speed up the process.

If you can't find a template that you like, [Create a flow from scratch](/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow), connect the services you want to use, and then add the triggers and actions that your scenario requires.

If you need inspiration, check out the list of the most [common ways to use forms in a flow](popular-scenarios.md).
