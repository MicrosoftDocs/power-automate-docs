The timeframe filter allows you to filter data by date and time ranges.

## Preset Time Ranges

Select from the following preset time range options:

- **Last hour** - Shows data from the past hour
- **Last 6 hours** - Shows data from the past 6 hours
- **Last 24 hours** - Shows data from the past 24 hours
- **Last 7 days** - Shows data from the past 7 days

## Custom Date and Time Range

To set a custom date and time range:

1. Select the **Custom** option
1. Set the **From** date and time:
   - Click the date picker to select a start date
   - Click the time picker to select a start time
1. Set the **To** date and time:
   - Click the date picker to select an end date
   - Click the time picker to select an end time

## Clearing Filters

- **Clear all** - Removes all date filters and resets the view
- **Clear custom filters** - Clears only the custom date and time range settings

Once you've made your selections:

Changes only take effect when you click Apply.
