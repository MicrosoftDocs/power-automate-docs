# Categorize cases

Case categorization allows you to identify which cases are finished, running, stuck, and incompletely imported. You can then use these categories in custom metrics.

Case categories are split into two groups:

- Exclusive (**Finished**, **Running**, and **Stuck**)

- Case flags (**Incompletely imported**)

A case can be placed in only one of the three categories: either it's **Finished**, **Running**, or **Stuck**. The **Incompletely imported** flag can be applied to any case, regardless of its category. For example, a case can be both **Running** and **Incompletely imported**.

## Create categorization rules

Set rules in simple or advanced mode. Any rule that you set in simple mode carries over to advanced mode. Change modes by turning **Advanced mode** on or off.

Following is an example of the simple mode, which appears when **Advanced mode** is turned off.

1. Enter the **Case categorization** screen from any location with the **Process context** selection.

    - **From the Processes screen:** Select **Process context**.

    - **From any other screen in the Power Automate Process Mining desktop app:** On the menu bar in the upper right corner, select **Process context**.

1. Set rules for categorizing cases as directed in the following sections.

1. Select **Save**.

## Categorize cases as Finished

Initially, all cases are categorized as **Finished**. Turn **Advanced mode** off to continue in simple mode.

Select which activities are finishing activities. Cases that end in one of these activities are considered **Finished**.

### Use the simple mode

In simple mode, select an activity (or multiple activities) in the **List** tab. Alternatively, search for an activity in the **Search in attribute values** field and then select it. You can also select the **Expression** tab and use the comparison dropdown menu and value field to define an activity in terms of an expression.

### Use the advanced mode

When **Advanced mode** is turned on, you have more options:

- Select a filter in the **Add filter** dropdown menu to specify attributes that define a finishing activity or use any combination of filters.

- Remove all filters.

- Use the import and export filters by selecting (**...**).

- Switch individual filters on or off.

## Categorize cases as Stuck

Cases that aren't **Finished** are either **Stuck** or **Running**. To distinguish between them, you can define when the case is considered **Stuck**. If a case isn't **Finished** and the time between the last activity in the case and the date you select exceeds the time value, the case is considered **Stuck**.

1. In simple mode, select **Stuck**.

1. Enter or select a date, or select the last event in the dataset.

1. Enter a time value.

When **Advanced mode** is turned on, you have more options:

1. Select a filter in the **Add filter** dropdown menu to specify attributes that define a **Stuck** case.

1. Use the import filter by selecting (**...**).

### Categorize cases as Running

Cases that aren't **Finished** or **Stuck** are considered **Running**.

The case is evaluated in sequence. If it satisfies the conditions for **Finished**, categorization stops there. If it doesn't, the app checks the conditions for **Stuck**. If those conditions are also false, it categorizes the case as **Running**.

### Categorize cases flagged as Incompletely imported

Cases that don't start where they should are flagged as **Incompletely imported**. This can happen when the export from the original data source split the case in half and only included the latter part of the case activities.

To clear the **Incompletely imported** flag, select which activities are starting activities.

1. In simple mode, select an activity (or multiple activities) in the **List** tab. Alternatively, search for an activity in the **Search in attribute values** field and then select it. You can also select the **Expression** tab and use the comparison dropdown menu and value field to define an activity in terms of an expression.

1. When **Advanced mode** is turned on, you have more options:

    - Select a filter in the **Add filter** dropdown menu. You can use any combination of filters.

    - Remove all filters.

    - Use the import and export filters by selecting (**...**).

    - Switch individual filters on or off.

## Use case categories

After you categorize the case, each category has its own function in custom metrics, returning True or False for each case:

- ISFINISHED()
- ISSTUCK()
- ISRUNNING()
- ISINCOMPLETEIMPORT()
