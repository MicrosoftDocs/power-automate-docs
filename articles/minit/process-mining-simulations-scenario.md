# Create a simulation scenario (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-top-note](../includes/cc-preview-features-top-note.md)]

A *simulation scenario* is a named set of modifications over an existing process model. By default, a simulation scenario creates the scenario based on actual process view data. You don’t need to define the entire scenario from the scratch. The simulation scenario creates only modifications to an existing statistical process model snapshot.

The modifications applied in the simulation scenario have no effect on process data. They don't change the output of process model or process analysis.

[!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

To run simulation, you need to create a simulation scenario first. To create a simulation scenario, follow these steps:

1. On the Power Automate Process Mining desktop app navigation bar, select **Process simulation**.
1. Select **Add simulation**.

    The **Process simulation** screen displays with three tabs:
    - General settings
    - Activities
    - Result Details

## Define scenario settings

This section explains some of the settings for your simulation scenario in the **General settings** tab. For example, general settings include name, description, currency, arrival time settings, and timetables/work schedules.

:::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-simulations-scenario/general-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'General settings' tab.":::

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the simulation scenario.
1. In the **Description** field, enter a description for the simulation scenario.
1. In the **Currency** dropdown menu, select the currency used for financial KPIs.
1. In the **Arrival time** section, define the settings that determine the arrival of cases in simulation.
    - In the **Instances** field, select the instance number.
    - In the **Scenario start at** field, select the date on the calendar to represent when the simulation scenario starts.
    - In the **Exclude at the start** and **Exclude from the end** fields, select the up or down arrow to exclude cases from the start and end of simulation when there's increasing and decreasing inflow of new cases. Exclusions filter out periods when there's no full workload or inflow from the simulated cases.

1. (Optional) In the **Timetables/Work schedules** section, select **Add new timetable** to add new timetables for working hours. These timetables can be assigned to Resources used in the simulation.
1. In the **Resources** group, add resources to the simulation scenario by following the instructions in the [Manage the workforce](#manage-the-workforce) section.

## Manage the workforce

A table resource allows you to manage the workforce for a simulation scenario. You can add, modify, or remove resources from the pool.

- To define a new resource, select **Add new resource**.
- To modify an existing resource, select a resource name.
- To remove resource, select the **x** in the fifth column of the resource.  

:::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-simulations-scenario/resource-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options to add, edit, and remove a resource.":::

To create and edit the workforce, enter the properties in the **Resource edit** screen.

The following table list the fields and a description or example:

|Field  |Description or example  |
|---------|---------|
|Name     | Name of the resource.    |
|Finance attribute     | Attribute used to calculate hourly cost. When no such financial attribute exists, select the **Simulation** value and enter hourly cost in **Cost per hour** field.<br/><br/>The value in this field can't be empty. Either select the **Simulation** value or any finance per hour attribute. If you use the **Simulation** value, the value from the **Cost per hour** field is used. Also, when you select a finance attribute but you updated a preloaded value in the field, that value for **Finance attribute** is changed to **Simulation**.       |
|Cost per hour     | Hourly cost for a resource when there’s no financial attribute. The value from the field is used when you select the **Simulation** value in the **Finance attribute** field.      |
|Parallel tasks amount     | The maximum number of parallel tasks a given resource can handle.        |
|Task processing efficiency    | How much more or less efficient the resource is compared to the default resource. A value above 1.0 means more efficient. A value below 1.0 means less efficient.  |
|Timetables/Work schedules     | Which working hours apply for a given resource.   |

## Modify activities

To modify activities in a simulation scenario, select the **Activities** tab on the **Process simulation** screen. The **Activities** tab displays a list of activities in the process model.

:::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-simulations-scenario/activities-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Activities' tab.":::

To display the screen for a specific activity, select the activity from the **Name** column.

The **Activity** screen contains three tabs:

- General settings
- Resources
- Sequence flows

Learn more about the tabs in the following sections.

### General settings

In the **General settings** tab, you can set the following items:

- **Modification (difference) for activity duration**: Activity duration is modeled based on original process. This setting allows you to change duration of each occurrence by defined difference.
- **Cost per activity**: To simulate cost of activity, it's possible to specify a process attribute that defines base cost of activity. Total cost per activity is base cost per activity plus cost of resource (duration multiplied by cost per hour).

:::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-simulations-scenario/activity-general-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the general settings for a specific activity.":::

### Resources

The **Resources** tab lists all resources and their work distribution on the activity for a given resource.

- To add a resource for a given activity, select **Add**.
- To remove a resource for a given activity, select the **x** at the end of the resource's row.
- To change work distribution for a selected resource, type the distribution number directly in the field, or use the up and down arrows.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The sum of all work distributions (probabilities) must be 100 percent.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-simulations-scenario/activity-resources.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the resources for a specific activity.":::

### Sequence flows

Use the **Sequence flows** tab to modify probabilities for the next activities and their waiting times.

For each activity in the **Next activity name** column, enter the following fields:

- **Probability (%)**: The probability of the next activity in terns of percentage.
- **Next activity waiting time**: The time between the end of the current activity and the start of the next activity.

## Start a simulation

Start the simulation and get an estimation of its duration in the **Process simulation** screen.

1. Return to the **Process simulation** screen.
1. To start the simulation, select **Simulate**.
1. View the expected estimation of the simulation duration next to **Simulate**.  

The status of the simulation scenario is indicated below the scenario’s tile. Examples of the status are **Queued for start** and **Completed**.
