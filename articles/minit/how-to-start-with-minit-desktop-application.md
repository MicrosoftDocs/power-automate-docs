# Standard installation of Power Automate Process Mining desktop app

Before you can start using Power Automate Process Mining desktop app, you need to download and install it to your desktop. You can do this using the standard installation from the Power Automate Process Mining web page, or with a custom installation.

The standard installation process requires access to Microsoft Windows App Installer. To find out if you access, contact your admin.

If you encounter difficulties due to company restrictions, contact your admin. Your admin might ask you to install the app from the MSIX file instead. Learn more in [Custom installation of Power Automate Process Mining desktop app](process-mining-custom-install.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Power Automate Process Mining desktop app is supported on Windows 10 and above. Windows Server systems aren't supported.

## Run the standard installation

To perform a custom installation, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. On the panel to the left, select **Process mining**.

1. At the top of the process mining screen, select **Download app**.

1. After the installer file downloads, select **Install** when prompted to run the installer.

   Allow a few minutes for the installer to download and install the application files.

1. When the welcome screen opens, select the preferred application language and select **Next step** to start the guided configuration wizard.

1. In the next step, accept the terms of use and confirm the choice of telemetry data collection, and then select **Next step**.

1. By default, the installation process stores process mining data in a new **Process Mining** folder in the **Documents** folder in your OneDrive. Change the location if necessary, and then select **Next step**.

    If the selected folder was used before, Power Automate Process Mining lets you choose whether you want to use the content of the folder (for example, data and settings from a previous installation), or clean up the folder. Select **Use** or **Cleanup** to specify your choice. To go back and change the storage location, select **Cancel**.

1. Select **Apply and Mine!** to finish the wizard.

1. Sign in to Power Automate Process Mining with your work account.

1. Start process mining from the **Processes** screen.
