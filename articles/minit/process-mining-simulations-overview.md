# Process simulations overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-top-note](../includes/cc-preview-features-top-note.md)]

*Process simulations* enable users to define simulation scenarios to validate business hypotheses. You define these scenarios through settings like resource allocation, arrival of cases, duration of activities, and modeling sequence of activities. You can simulate the impact of proposed changes before you apply the changes into production.

[!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

Process simulations in Power Automate process mining use machine learning statistical modeling over process model to mimic real world behavior. Modifications to a process snapshot for simulation scenario donâ€™t affect the existing process. These modifications allow you to continue with process mining analysis with original data without interruptions.

Process simulations are part of Power Automate Process Mining desktop app. The articles in the **Process simulations (preview)** section provide an overview of the simulation process, how to set up a simulation scenario, and how to run a simulation scenario.
