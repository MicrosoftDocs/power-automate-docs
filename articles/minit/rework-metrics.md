# Rework metrics

Rework metrics represent a layer of data analysis with a focus on identifying various kinds of repetitions found in a process. Rework information is covered in the **Statistics** screen and can be visualized on the process map for better understanding the root cause of each repetition and its overall impact. Reducing repetitions is crucial for improving the efficiency of the process as well as reducing costs.

The following sections list the types of rework metrics.

## Self-loop

Self-loop represents a specific repetition where an activity is directly followed by the same activity. In terms of edges and transitions, the starting and ending activity of edge is the same.

### Example of self-loop

The activity called *BP Transfer* repeats itself nine (9) times. There are zero values over all the other activities and edges because no other activities are involved in this type of repetition.

## Loop

Loop represents specific repetition where an activity is followed by the same activity, but not directly. For example, at least one additional activity is always involved.

### Example of loop

Activities *SetDeliveryDate* and *Approve* are repeated seven (7) times. The edge between these two activities is also repeated seven (7) times. Keep in mind that in a process map, an activity might be repeated, but each time a different edge or transition can be used. The loop count value for a non-repeated edge is zero, regardless of the loop count for the starting or ending activity of the edge.

## Rework

Rework count represents the sum of all self-loops and loops.

### Example of rework

The number of self-loops of the activity *BP Transfer* displays with the number of loops of the activities *SetDeliveryDate* and *Approve*. If any of the activities contained both self-loops and loops, their numbers would add up.

## Loop inflow

Loop inflow represents the repetitions of an activity's predecessors.

### Example of loop inflow

In this example, the activity *SetDeliveryDate* has been repeated seven (7) times, so the loop inflow for the activity *Approve* is also seven (7), as *SetDeliveryDate* is the only predecessor of *Approve*.

As the activity *SetDeliveryDate* has been preceded by non-repeated activities, its loop inflow value is zero, regardless of the number of repetitions of itself. However, the edge between *SetDeliveryDate* and *Approve* has a non-zero value as the starting activity was repeated.

## Loop outflow

Loop outflow represents the repetitions of an activity's successors.

### Example of loop outflow

The activity *Approve* has the value of zero, none of the successor activities was repeated. *SetDeliveryDate* shows value 7, as activity's *Approve* loop count equals 7. The edge between *SetDeliveryDate* and *Approve* shows value 7, as the ending edge activity *Approve* has been repeated 7 times.

### Net loop gain

This activity metric represents the difference between *Loop outflow* and *Loop inflow*. If the value is positive, the activity is directly followed by more repeated activities than it was preceded. Such activities start new loops in processes. If the value is negative, the activity is directly followed by less repeated activities than it was preceded. Such activities end, close, or exit loops in processes. The halo effect color also helps us see positive and negative trends in the process - red color represents a problem (start of new loops); the blue color represents a favorable change (end of loops).

### Example of net loop gain

*SetDeliveryDate* is followed by repeated activity *Approve* while it has no repeated predecessors (value 0). The activity is thus involved in the creation of seven (7) new loops (value 7). Activity *Approve* is not followed by a repeated activity (value 0), but its predecessors are repeated seven (7) times. The activity *Approve* is thus involved in closing seven (7) loops (value -7).

## Rework metrics - process map

In rework metrics, the map displays information representing the volume of repetitions for activities and edges the process involves.

To display the rework information:

1. On the panel on the right, select **Customize** (the top icon).

1. On the **Customize** toolbar, select **Rework**.

    You can select if one metric is used both for activities and edges, or each metric is set separately. To switch between count and percentage for each metric, select **%**.

The list of metrics is the same for both activities and edges, with one exception. Metric **Net Loop Gain** is available only for activities.

By selecting an activity or edge, you can display rework details about the particular object. The percentage represents the proportion of the individual types of reworks to the overall number of instances.

## Rework metrics - statistics

In the **Statistics** screen, the rework information is available for **Case overview**, **Activities**, **Edge statistics**, **Resources**, and all event-level attribute statistics.

The rework columns are located at the far-right end of the table and the information can be also displayed in the chart. The percentage is calculated from the **Event frequency** value. In **Case overview**, it's calculated from the **Event** count.

Information about reworks is also present in the overview panel. The percentage shows the proportion of the displayed rows that contain self-loops, loops, and reworks. In the following example, one out of two cases contains a self-loop so the overview panel shows **50%** average self-loop. Similarly, one out of the two contains a loop. This is why the average loop shows **50%**. This means that both cases contain a rework, so the average rework shows **100%**.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of an overview of reworks." source="media/rework-stats.png":::

In this example, one case contains one self-loop and one loop. The other one doesn't contain any reworks. That means the average self-loop, average loop, and average rework fields in the overview panel are **50%** because only one of the two cases contain them.

## Rework metrics - filters

The Metrics filter supports filtering per case according to the amount of self-loops, loops, and reworks.

Filters **Attributes (conditional)** and **Edge (conditional)** allow using rework metrics filter per event.
