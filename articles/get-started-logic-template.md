# Create a cloud flow from a template in Power Automate

A good way to get started is to use a template that is suited to your organization's scenario. You can choose from a collection of templates to find the one that best matches your scenario. Search [all templates](https://make.powerautomate.com/templates/) or browse by category to find your scenario, and then follow the steps in the template to create a cloud flow from the template.

The following video gives insights into using templates to create your flows.

You can tweak templates by adding, editing, or removing triggers and actions to create your own flows. You can [copy paste actions](/business-applications-release-notes/april19/microsoft-flow/copy-paste-actions) in the same flow or across flows to speed up the your tweaks.

Create a cloud flow from one of many built-in templates that can, for example, send you a Slack message when your manager sends you an email in Microsoft 365.

>[!TIP]
>[Create a cloud flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.

Here, we'll follow an example that uses a template to create a flow that sends you a Slack message when your manager sends you an email in Microsoft 365.

## Prerequisites

To complete this example, you'll need accounts with access to the following:

- [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
- Slack.
- Microsoft 365.

## Choose a template

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), and then select **Templates** in the left-side navigation pane.
1. Use the search bar to search for **slack manager** to find the **Send a message on Slack when my manager emails me** template, and then select it.
1. If you aren't signed into Office or Slack, select **Sign in** and then follow the prompts.
1. After you confirm your connections, select **Continue**.

    Your flow appears, showing each action with an orange title bar.

## Customize your flow

1. Select the title bar for an event to expand it, and then customize it (for example, by specifying a filter on the email that interests you).
1. Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.
  
    For example, the **Post message** action is expanded because you need to enter a channel, such as your *\@username*. You can also customize the message content. By default, the message will contain just the subject, but you can include other information.

1. Near the top of the screen, specify a name for your flow, and then select **Create flow**.
1. Finally, if you're happy with your flow, select **Save**.

Now, when your manager sends you an email, you'll receive a Slack message that contains the information that you specified.
