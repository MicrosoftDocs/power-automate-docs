# Use Power Automate flows as plugins in Copilot for Microsoft 365 (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-preview-features-top-note](./includes/cc-preview-features-top-note.md)]

You can run Power Automate flows as plugins from Copilot for Microsoft 365. This feature is currently limited to two specific copilot-enabled templates currently. The ability for users to bring any flow they create with the **Run from Copilot** trigger in Copilot for Microsoft 365 isn't available yet.

[!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Prerequisites

To use flows as plugins in Copilot for Microsoft 365, you need a license and the ability to enable plugins. To learn more, go to [Licenses for Copilot for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-business-applications#get-copilot-for-microsoft-365-licenses-and-enable-plugins).

## Deploy the app

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?#/homepage) with your admin account.
1. On the navigation pane, expand **Settings**, and then select **Integrated apps**.
1. On the **Available apps** tab, search for **Power Automate**, and then select **Deploy App**.
1. To open the **Users** tab, select **Next**.
1. Choose to deploy for all users, a specific set of users, or yourself.
1. To complete the remaining steps to deploy the app, select **Next**.

    It might take up to 12 hours for the deployed app's plugin to show in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

## Enable flow plugins templates

There are currently two templates that use the **Run from Copilot** trigger that can be used as plugins from Power Automate:

- [Get my tasks from Microsoft To Do and Microsoft Planner](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/~default/galleries/public/templates/a044e5f4f7214971b8c631f1014cef92): This flow lists all your pending tasks from Microsoft To Do and Microsoft Planner and surfaces them in Copilot for Microsoft 365.
- [List my pending approvals](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/~default/galleries/public/templates/d851f07c146246f3ad2c0d5bedd01539): This flow lists all your pending approvals in an environment and surfaces them in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

To sign in and create flows based on these templates, select the above templates. Once created, they show up as plugins in Copilot for Microsoft 365. It can take up to four (4) hours for the flow plugin to show up in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

## Running flows from Copilot for Microsoft 365

You can use the flow based plugins shipped by Microsoft in your Copilot for Microsoft 365 app in Microsoft Teams.

1. Log in to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com).
1. Open the **M365 Chat** app.

    If the Copilot app isn't on your menu, search for it in the Teams app store. A plugins icon (four squares) shows on the text prompt.

1. Enter a natural language prompt like **Get my pending approvals**, or **Show me my pending tasks from Microsoft Planner and To Do**, to get the results.

## Environment support

Currently, the flows that are created and run need to be in the tenant's default environment. A setup experience for the plugin that allows users to choose nondefault environments to associate the plugin with isn't available yet.
