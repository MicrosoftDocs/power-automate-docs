# Find a saved cloud flow

New cloud flows are saved in the **My flows** section of Power Automate. If you have many flows, it can be difficult to find the one you want. This article describes how to find a saved cloud flow.

## Find cloud flows easily

You can use the **Search** field on the **Cloud flows**, **Desktop flows**, **Generative actions (preview)**, or **Shared with me** tabs to display only flows that match the search terms you enter.

The search filter finds only cloud flows that were loaded onto the page. If you don't find your flow, try selecting **Load more** at the bottom of the page.

## More options to find cloud flows

If you can't find your cloud flow, try one of the solutions in the following table.

|Scenario  |Solution  |
|---------|---------|
|The cloud flow might be in a different environment.      | Learn how to change environments in [Environment information and settings](getting-started.md#3--environment-information-and-settings).      |
|The cloud flow was shared.   | Check the **Shared with me** tab in **My Flows** menu option. (For an example, refer to the screenshot in [Find cloud flows easily](#find-cloud-flows-easily)(#find-your-cloud-flows-easily) in this article.)       |
| You were possibly removed as an owner of the cloud flow.    |  Contact the flow owner to be re-added. Learn how to find out if youâ€™re an owner of the cloud flow in [Remove an owner](create-team-flows.md#remove-an-owner).       |
| The flow was possibly deleted.     | Learn how to restore the flow in [Restore deleted flows](how-tos-restore-deleted-flow.md).        |
