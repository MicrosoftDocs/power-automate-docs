# Export and import your process in process advisor

You can copy or move process advisor processes from one environment to another using Microsoft Power Platform solutions. You need to be an owner or co-owner of a process to export it.

To learn more about solutions from Microsoft Power Platform, go to [Overview of solution-aware flows](overview-solution-flows.md).

## Export a process

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

    Make sure you've selected the environment where the process you want to export has been created.

1. Select **Solutions** in the navigation pane on the left.

1. In the list, select the solution you want to use to add your process, or create a solution and select it.

1. Select **Add existing** > **PM Inferred Task**.

1. Search for and select the process you want to export, and then select **Add**.

You can now export your solution and import it in another environment.

For more information about solution export, go to [Export a solution](export-flow-solution.md).
