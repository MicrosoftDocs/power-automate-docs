# Use the Apply to each action to process a list of items periodically

Many triggers can immediately start a cloud flow based on an event such as when a new email arrives in your inbox. These triggers are great, but sometimes you want to run a cloud flow that queries a data source on a predefined schedule, taking certain actions based on the properties of the items in the data source. To do this, your flow can be started on a schedule (such as once per day) and use a loop action such as **Apply to each** to process a list of items. For example, you could use **Apply to each** to update records from a database or list of items from Microsoft SharePoint.

Watch this video for a demo of the **Apply to each** action.

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWL7EL]

In this tutorial, we'll create a cloud flow that runs every 15 minutes and does the following:

1. Gets the last 10 unread messages in your Microsoft 365 Outlook Inbox.

2. Checks each of the 10 messages to confirm if any has **meet now** in the subject.

3. Checks if the email is from your boss or was sent with high importance.

4. Sends a push notification and marks as read, any email that has **meet now** in the subject and is either from your boss or was sent with high importance.

This diagram shows the details of the flow we'll create.

## Create a cloud flow

# [Classic designer](#tab/classic-designer)

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. Select **My flows** > **New flow** > **Scheduled cloud flow**.

1. In the **Flow name** field, enter a name for your flow.

1. In the **Starting** fields, select the date and time to indicate when the flow should start running.

1. In the **Repeat every** fields, set the schedule to run the flow. In this example, type 15 and select **Minute** from the dropdown menu to run the flow every 15 minutes.

1. Select **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/apply-to-each/foreach-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options to set up a scheduled flow.":::

1. Select **+ New step**.

1. In the **Search** field, type **outlook** to find all connectors and actions related to Microsoft Outlook.

1. Select the **Get emails (V3)** action to open the **Get emails (V3)** card.

1. Configure the **Get emails (V3)** card to select the top 10 unread emails from the **Inbox** folder.

   Don't include attachments because they won't be used in the flow.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/apply-to-each/foreach-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a configured email card.":::

So far, you've created a simple flow that gets some emails from your inbox. These emails will be returned in an array. The **Apply to each** action requires an array, so this is exactly what's needed.

# [Edit with Copilot (preview)](#tab/edit-with-copilot-preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

1. Try asking Copilot to create a flow by typing this prompt: 

    **Every 15 minutes, Get top 10 unread emails and get my manager. If the email is from my manager OR the email is Important and subject contains 'meet now', send me a push notification to my phone.**

    Copilot suggests a flow based on your prompt:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/apply-to-each/copilot-apply-to-each-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a flow suggestion from Copilot.":::

1. Select **Next** and review the connections.
1. Select **Next** and your flow appears on the designer.

    The flow is preconfigured with all the required fields in the designer.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/apply-to-each/copilot-configured-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a flow created by Copilot based on your prompt.":::

1. Save the flow and it's ready to use.
