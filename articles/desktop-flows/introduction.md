# Introduction to Power Automate Desktop

Power Automate Desktop broadens the existing robotic process automation (RPA) capabilities in Power Automate and enables you to automate all repetitive desktop processes. It’s quicker and easier than ever to automate with the new intuitive Power Automate Desktop designer using the prebuilt drag-and-drop actions or recording your own [desktop flows](create-flow.md) to run later. 

Leverage automation capabilities in Power Automate Desktop. Create flows, interact with everyday tools such as email and excel or work with modern and legacy applications. Examples of simple and complex tasks you can automate are: 

- Quickly organize your documents using dedicated files and folders actions 

- Accurately extract data from websites and store them in excel files using Web and Excel automation

- Apply desktop automation capabilities to put your work on autopilot  

Power Automate Desktop is addressed to home users, small businesses, enterprises or larger companies. It’s addressed essentially to everyone who is performing simple or complex rule-based tasks on their workstations.

In case you are a home user who is accessing a weather website to see tomorrow's forecast, or a self-employed businessperson who extracts information from vendors' invoices or even an employee of a large enterprise who automates data entry on an ERP system, Power Automate Desktop is designed for you. 

It allows you to automate both legacy applications, such as terminal emulators, modern web and desktop applications, Excel files, and folders. Interact with the machine using application UI elements, images, or coordinates.
