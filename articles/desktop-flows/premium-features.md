## Plans that provide entitlements for the premium RPA features

### Trial plan

The Power Automate for desktop free trial plan is available for 90 days. Free users in an organization can sign up for this trial through the **Start trial** option found within the **Go premium** section of Power Automate for desktop or the **desktop flows** sections of the Power Automate portal. Free users are also prompted to start a trial while they attempt to add the **Run a flow built with Power Automate for desktop** action in a cloud flow.

### Standalone plan

The Power Automate Premium plan (paid or trial, previously Power Automate per user with attended RPA) gives full access to all RPA premium features and benefits. Both Power Platform admins and individual users and makers can purchase licenses for Power Automate. You can find more information about purchasing Power Automate licenses in [Buy Power Automate licenses](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/buy-licenses).

### Pay-as-you-go plan

Pay-as-you-go is a new way to pay for Power Automate using an Azure subscription. This allows you to get started building and sharing flows without any license commitment or upfront purchasing. Desktop flow users in a pay-as-you-go-enabled environment have access to most of the premium features listed above in the scope of that specific environment. You can find more information regarding the pay-as-you-go plan in [Pay-as-you-go plan](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-overview).
