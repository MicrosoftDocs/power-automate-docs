# Tags in desktop flows (preview)

Tags are available (in preview) in the console of Power Automate for desktop, to help you categorize and group desktop flows together. Tags have the form of custom text labels, which allow you to easily organize your flows and manage them more efficiently.

The **Tags (Preview)** column displays all the tags that are associated with a desktop flow. To manage (e.g. add or remove) the tags of a flow, you can select the option **Manage tags (Preview)** in its context menu in the console. Alternatively, you can bring up the **Flow properties** pane and navigate directly to the **Tags (preview)** section.

## Prerequisites

- Power Automate for desktop version 2.55 or later.
- Dataverse solution version 1.9.1.1 or later. To confirm the latest version used, navigate to the portal of Power Automate, then navigate to **Solutions** > **History** and search for the key term *MicrosoftFlowExtensionsCore*.
- Tags are only available for users with a work or school account.
- This feature requires an environment where the [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md) is enabled. In v1 schema environments, tags aren't available.


## Known limitations

- Tags can't be renamed. They can only be deleted and new ones can be created in their place.
