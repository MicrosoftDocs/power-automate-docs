# Tags in desktop flows


## Prerequisites

- Power Automate for desktop 2.55 or later.
- Dataverse solution version 1.9.1.1 or later
- Tags are only available for users with a work or school account.
- This feature requires an environment where the [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md) is enabled. In v1 schema environments, UI elements collections aren't available.


## Known limitations

- Tags can't be renamed. They can only be deleted and new ones can be created in their place.
