# Introduction to other types of desktop flows

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This article covers topics related to legacy systems. Migrate your flows created with these solutions to Power Automate for desktop or delete them.
>
> - Selenium IDE is deprecated and will no longer work after February 28th, 2023.
> - Windows recorder (V1) is deprecated and no longer works.

Read on if you already have automation built using Windows recorder (V1) and Selenium IDE.

You can jump right in:

- [Create and test Windows recorder (V1) flows for desktop applications](create-desktop.md) 
- [Create and test Selenium IDE flows for Web applications](create-web.md)  

### Desktop flows or connectors?

With Power Automate, you can automate both modern applications with APIs, or legacy applications with incomplete or missing APIs. You can even combine legacy apps, modern apps, and manual processes in a single automation.

| **Application type**      | **Feature** | **Benefits**     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Modern apps with APIs| Connectors                 | High reliability with software UI updates |
| Legacy apps (no APIs)          | desktop flows                    | Easy to create. Works if no API is available.   |


You will find your desktop flows alongside automated, button, scheduled, and business process flows in [**My flows**](manage.md).
