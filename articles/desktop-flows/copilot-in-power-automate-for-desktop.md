# Get started with Copilot in Power Automate for desktop (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Copilot in desktop flows allows you to create automation that helps streamline your workflow creation quickly and easily using natural language. You can create a new flow or add more steps to an existing flow by just describing what you want to achieve using natural language prompts.

[!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - Copilot is a new technology that is still being developed. It is optimized for use with English language and has limited support with other languages. As such, parts of it may appear in English rather than your preferred language.
> - Copilot’s Natural Language to flow creation is powered by the Azure OpenAI service. This feature is in Early Access.
> - Copilot’s generative answers capability is powered by the Azure OpenAI Service and Bing Search.

Copilot can perform the following actions:

- Understand your intent and create a new flow or enhance an existing one based on the scenario prompt you provide.
- Apply the necessary parameters in the actions based on your prompt.
- Answer product related questions. For example, you can ask Copilot questions about desktop flows such as:
  - How do I read data from an Excel file?
  - How do I run a PowerShell script?

## Create a desktop flow using Copilot (preview)

You can create a new flow in the Power Automate for desktop console from either Copilot in the home page or from the Copilot side panel.
To create a flow from the home page, type your prompt in Copilot’s chat area:

:::image type="content" source="media/pad-copilot/power-automate-desktop-copilot-console-home.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to interact with Copilot in Power Automate for desktop's home.":::

To create a flow from the Copilot side panel, open the Copilot chat panel by pressing the Copilot button on the top right corner of the console and type your prompt. Make sure that the flow creation mode is selected from the drop-down menu:

Alternatively, you can also access the generative answers capability from the designer’s vertical menu on the right side.

:::image type="content" source="media/pad-copilot/power-automate-desktop-copilot-console-side-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Copilot side panel in Power Automate for desktop console's home location.":::

Once you submit your prompt, Copilot processes it and launches the designer with the newly generated flow for you to review. In the designer’s Copilot side panel, you can view a list of the actions that were generated. The actions are assigned in groups based on their functionality. You can view the actions contained in each group by expanding it. Lastly, these groups are translated to regions in the main designer’s panel.

:::image type="content" source="media/pad-copilot/power-automate-desktop-copilot-designer-copilot-side-panel.png" alt-text="A screenshot that shows the designer opened with the actions generated by Copilot.":::

In the designer's main area, Copilot-generated actions are delineated with a pair of comments: an initial comment to signal the start and a concluding comment following the final action. This demarcation is intended to streamline the process of finding and examining these actions.

If Copilot identifies an intention to automate browser or UI tasks, it inserts an action placeholder. This placeholder serves as a starting point for you to initiate the recorder and capture the user actions. After you complete this step, the action placeholder is automatically replaced with the actions created by the recorder. You can also delete the action and add the necessary UI actions manually.

> [!NOTE]
> The recording action produces a design time error. This is to remind you that a significant part of the flow is still missing and needs to be created. To resolve this, you can either launch the recorder and perform the recording or delete / disable it.

## Adding actions to an existing flow using Copilot (preview)

You can enhance an existing flow with ease by instructing Copilot to add more functionality to it. To do so, navigate to the Power Automate for desktop’s designer and describe in the Copilot side panel what you want to achieve. Copilot adds the appropriate actions at the end of your flow, or underneath a selected action. Make sure that the appropriate Copilot skill is enabled before typing your prompt by either selecting the **Add a step that** button on the top of the Copilot side panel or by selecting it from the drop-down menu at the bottom.

## How to write a good prompt

Writing good prompts includes more than just being specific with your request, or saying how you want your results to be displayed. If the initial results aren’t what you’re looking for, try tweaking your prompt and running it again.

- Be as specific as possible. Instead of a generic prompt like, *Email an Excel file*, try the following prompt instead:
  - Send an email to sales@contoso.com from the account accounting@contoso.com with subject "Contoso sales data" and attach the Excel file in "C:\contoso\contoso.xlsx"
- Try tweaking your prompt to further fine tune.

- Copilot supports English language only.

### Why some of the generated actions marked erroneous when I create a flow or add actions to an existing flow using Copilot?

Copilot generates actions based on your prompt. If the prompt doesn't include the mandatory parameters of an action, its left empty when generated and is marked as erroneous. You can try providing a more detailed prompt to avoid having actions with empty parameters. For example, a prompt such as *Open an excel file and read all data* results in a design time error, as the Excel file path is a mandatory parameter of the Launch Excel action. If the instruction is to *Open the Excel file located at "c:\contoso\myExcel.xlsx" and read all data*, then the Launch Excel action is prefilled with the file path, ensuring no design time errors occur.

### What are some example prompts I can use to create flows?

- *Check if the folder c:\contoso exists. If it does, search for all Excel files. Add every Excel file found into an archive c:\Contoso\archivedExcels.zip using the best compression level.*
- *Search in the Excel file c:\contoso\employees_list.xlsx for the string "Foo" in any of the cells. If there's a match, send an email using Outlook from the account sales@contoso.com to accounting@contoso.com with Subject "Here is your Excel file" and attach the Excel file.*
- *Read the text from the file c:\contoso\sample_text.txt. Replace any occurrences of `<telephone number>` with 514-444 5555 and any occurrences of `<email address>` with sales@contoso.com. Lastly, display the whole text in a dialog and email the text file to accounting@contoso.com with subject: "Here's the text that I parsed." Put in the email body the text of the file and also attach the file.*
- *Add a PowerShell script that performs an API call to https://contoso.com/api_endpoint and passes the "employee_details" variable. Then create a new Excel file and write the employee_details variable to it. Lastly, save the Excel file to c:\contoso\employees.xlsx*
- *Add an action that compresses the following folder "C:\Users\contoso\Desktop\Invoices" and save it on my desktop.
- Open the following Excel file "C:\Users\contoso\Desktop\data.xlsx" and delete column B from the first sheet. Then save the Excel file and close it.*
- *Connect to my email account sales@contoso.com, search for the last email sent by accounting@contoso.com and display in a message the order number from that email's subject.*
- *Create a flow that prompts the user for the name of an application and then searches for that application to check if it's running. If not, use run application to launch it by first locating its exe from program files.*
- *Find all png files in c:\temp and to compress them in a new file with name pngs.zip.*
- *Connect to the SQL Database "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;" and get the row count of the table car_entries.*
