Process migrator for Softomotive products (preview) enables users to convert automations into desktop flows for use in Power Automate.

This migration utility redefines automations to their equivalent Power Automate desktop flow action definitions where such parity exists. 

Some actions have been deprecated because they don't fit into the Power Platform ecosystem. However, workarounds should be applicable to overcome what appears to be missing functionality.

    > [!TIP]
    > Running the Process migrator for Softomotive products (preview) will be paused once an encrypted process has been encountered, waiting for the password to be inserted by the user. It's advised to group processes based on whether they are encrypted or not. This way, unencrypted processes will be migrated without supervision and the encrypted ones will have the required user attendance.
