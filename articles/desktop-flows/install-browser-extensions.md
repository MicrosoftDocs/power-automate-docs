# Install Power Automate browser extensions

To automate web-related tasks, Power Automate provides a built-in Automation browser that's set up for you and works out of the box.

Power Automate also supports the four most popular browsers: Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. These browsers need extra setup and extensions to work with Power Automate.

## Install browser extensions

When installation of Power Automate for desktop is complete, the installer prompts you to install the Power Automate extension for your browser. The links in the installer send you to the appropriate extension store.

# Set up browsers

To make sure that your browser works as expected with Power Automate, you'll need to turn off a couple of features.

- Microsoft Edge: Go to **Settings** > **System** and turn off **Continue running background apps when Microsoft Edge is closed**.

- Google Chrome: Go to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **System** and turn off **Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed**.

- Mozilla Firefox: Firefox alerts that freeze the browser and prevent users from switching to other tabs or windows may affect your desktop flows. Turn off this feature.

  1. Enter **about:config** in the address bar.
  1. Search for the **prompts.tab_modal.enabled** preference in the list and change it to **false**.

- Internet Explorer: By default, Internet Explorer works in protected mode to prevent any external application from controlling it. While Power Automate can still work with this setting turned on, it won't be able to clear the browser's cache or cookies. Turn off protected mode.

  1. Select the **gear icon**, and then select **Internet options**.
  1. Navigate to **Security** > **Internet** and turn off **Enable Protected Mode**. Repeat the same step for the **Local intranet** and **Trusted sites** zones.

        :::image type="content" source="media/install-browser-extensions/internet-explorer-internet-protected-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the security tab in Internet Explorer options.":::

  1. Select **OK**.

- Internet Explorer for servers: To use Internet Explorer in Windows Servers, you must turn off **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration**.

Additionally, it prevents web helpers from working as expected.

  1. Select **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration**.
