# Edit Selenium IDE flows

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This section covers topics to develop automations using legacy systems:
> - Selenium IDE: If you are just starting your RPA automation project, we recommend that you use Power Automate for desktop instead.
> - Windows recorder (V1): From November 30th, desktop flows will no longer be supported. Migrate your flows to Power Automate for desktop or delete them.

Selenium IDE flows automate websites running in the [Microsoft Edge (version 80 or later)](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) or Google Chrome. After you've [created a Web UI flow](create-web.md), you might need to edit it. Follow the steps in this document to learn how to edit your Selenium IDE flows.

## Edit in Selenium IDE

Use the Selenium IDE to edit your Selenium IDE flows.

>[!NOTE]
>Editing in the Selenium IDE is aimed at advanced users and developers.

You can refer to the [Selenium Commands](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/) to learn how to edit the script.

The Selenium IDE suggests different selectors and a default one when targeting a user interface element. You can also define a new selector if none of the proposed selectors are appropriate. This usually happens when the websiteâ€™s HTML structure is highly dynamic.

Here is an example of possible selectors that the Selenium IDE identified:

## Accessing a property of an object variable or item of an array variable**

This advanced capability lets you use syntax like \${foo.bar} to access the bar property of the foo object. You can also write to the bar property of foo by using foo.bar as the value property in a store command. You can also use syntax such as \${foo[0]} to access the item at index 0 in the foo array.
