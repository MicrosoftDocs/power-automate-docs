# How to use Process capacity

> [!NOTE]
>
> Process capacity and Unattended RPA capacity have been combined in a single capacity pool and can be used interchangeably within the Power Automate platform. They have exactly the same value and role.

As a reminder, within the Power Automate portal :
- each Process capacity is based on a purchased [Process license](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types)
- each legacy Unattended RPA capacity is based on an [Unattended RPA add-on](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/add-ons#unattended-rpa-add-on).

A Process capacity, or legacy Unattended RPA capacity, can be **allocated to a machine or to a cloud flow**. When allocated to a cloud flow, it becomes a **Process plan** based on which the cloud flow is licensed to run premium actions independantly from the user license. 

## Allocating Process capacity to a machine

When a Process capacity is allocated to a machine, it becomes an **unattended bot**. Each unattended bot on a machine can carry one unattended desktop flow run at a time. So if a machine needs to execute multiple unattended runs simultaneously, it needs as many unattended bots as it has simultaneous unattended runs to perform. 

To allocated a Process capacity to a machine, go to the machine details page, click on Settings :

![Machine page - No unattended bot](media/capacity-utilization/machine-page-0-bot.png)

Check how many bots your machine can support and if you have available Process capacity :

![Machine page - Settings - No unattended bot](media/capacity-utilization/machine-page-setting-0-bot.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> The "Machine max bot bot supported" parameter depends on your machine and its OS. The maximum value this parameter can reach is 10 (for some Windows Servers)
> The "Available capacity in the environment" inform you about how many unattended bots can still be created. Keep in mind that the Process capacity is a shared resources between all users within an environment and so use only what you need
> For a global overview on how the Process capacity is used within the environment, use the "Manage capacity utilization" link (it will also provide the option to request more capacity)
> The "Enable auto-allocation" parameter, when turned on, allows unattended bots to automatically be allocated to a machine when an unattended run requires it (multiple unattended bots can be auto-allocated in case on simulateneous unattended runs)

You now have a machine that can perform unattended RPA :

## Allocating Process capacity to a cloud flow

When a Process capacity is allocated to a cloud flow, it becomes a **Process plan** based on which the cloud flow is licensed to run premium actions independantly from the user license. 

To allocated a Process capacity to a cloud flow, go to the cloud flow details page, click on Edit :

![Cloud flow page - User plan](media/capacity-utilization/cloud-flow-user-plan.png)

The cloud flow is by default based the user plan:

![Cloud flow page - Settings - User plan](media/capacity-utilization/cloud-flow-setting-user-plan.png)

Change the plan used by the flow to the Process plan and save : 

![Cloud flow page - Settings - Process plan](media/capacity-utilization/cloud-flow-setting-flow-plan.png)

The cloud flow is now independant from the user license :

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Process capacity allocation to cloud flow will be updated in a future release
