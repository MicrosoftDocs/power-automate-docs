# Custom actions

Custom actions developed by your organization and uploaded to the respective environments can be included in desktop flows and utilized like actions that belong in the standard library of automation actions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Custom actions in Power Automate for desktop is a premium feature which requires a [Power Automate subscription](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/pricing/).
> - This feature requires Power Automate for desktop v2.32 or later.

Custom actions exist at the environment level. As a best practice, use a "dev&mdash;test&mdash;prod" model when developing custom actions.
