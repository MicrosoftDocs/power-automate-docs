Automate PDF files and their content (text and images)

[Extract text from PDF](#extracttextfrompdfaction)  
[Extract tables from PDF](#extracttablesfrompdfaction)  
[Extract images from PDF](#extractimagesfrompdfaction)  
[Extract PDF file pages to new PDF file](#extractpages)  
[Merge PDF files](#mergefiles)  


## Getting started with PDF actions

The PDF group of actions enables you to extract images, text, and tables from PDF files and arrange pages to create new documents.

To extract text from a PDF file, use the **Extract text from PDF** action. In the following example, the action has been configured to extract text from a specific range of pages. The file is password-protected, so a password has been populated in the **Advanced** settings.

To extract images, deploy the **Extract images from PDF** action. This action has a similar structure as the previous one, but it contains an additional option to specify a prefix for the image names.

To extract tables from a PDF file, use the **Extract tables from PDF** action. In the action properties, specify the PDF file and the pages to extract from. The action produces a variable named **ExtractedPDFTables** that contains a list of PDF table info. You can find information regarding handling this type of variables in [Advanced data types](../variable-data-types.md#advanced-data-types).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Extract tables from PDF** action doesn't use Optical Character Recognition (OCR), so you can't extract non-copyable text from scanned PDFs. 

> [!NOTE]
> The library behind the action occasionally extracts additional PDF data that aren't tables. This functionality minimizes the risk of accidentally omitting a real table.

Apart from extracting information from PDF files, you can create a new PDF document from an existing file using the **Extract PDF file pages to new PDF file** action. 

In the following example, the source document and the file name of the new document have been specified. In addition, the pages have been selected as a combination of specific pages and a range.
