## Getting started with PDF actions

Use the PDF action group to extract images and text from PDF files and arrange pages to create new documents.

To extract text from a PDF file, use the **Extract text from PDF** action. In the example below, a file has been specified, and the action is configured to extract text from a range of pages. In the **Advanced** section, a password has been entered to access the secure file.

Similarly, extract images with the **Extract images from PDF** action. This action contains an additional option to specify a prefix for the image names.

To create a new PDF document from an existing file, use the **Extract PDF file pages to new PDF file**. In the example below, the source document has been selected, and a file name for a new document has been specified. The pages have been entered as a combination of specific pages and a range.
