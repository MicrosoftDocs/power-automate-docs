# PDF actions

PDF actions enable you to extract images, text, and tables from PDF files, and arrange pages to create new documents.

To extract text from a PDF file, use the **Extract text from PDF** action. The following example extracts text from a specific range of pages of a password-protected file. The password is specified in the **Advanced** settings.

To extract texts arranged in a tabular form, enable **Optimize for structured data** to improve the results' format and accuracy.

To extract tables from a PDF file, deploy the **Extract tables from PDF** action, select the file, and specify the pages to extract from.

The action produces the **ExtractedPDFTables** variable that contains a list of PDF table info. To find information about this type of list, go to [Advanced data types](../variable-data-types.md#advanced-data-types).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The **Extract tables from PDF** action doesn't use Optical Character Recognition (OCR), so you can't extract non-copyable text from scanned PDFs.
> - The library behind the action occasionally extracts additional PDF data that aren't tables. This functionality minimizes the risk of accidentally omitting a real table.

Apart from extracting information from PDF files, you can create a new PDF document from an existing file using the **Extract PDF file pages to new PDF file** action.

The following example selects a combination of specific pages and a range of pages.
