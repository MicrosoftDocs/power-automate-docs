## Getting started with wait actions

Use wait actions to delay running subsequent actions in the flow until a certain event occurs.

To create a delay before the next action, use a **Wait** action. This action sets a timer and resumes the flow when the time elapses.

To create a delay until a specific file appears, use the **Wait for file** action. This action requires the path, filename of the expected file. In the example below, the action is set to fail with a timeout error if the specified file does not appear in the specified directory for 300 seconds.

![Screenshot of wait for file action properties.](\media\wait\wait-for-file-example.png)

When working with UI elements, create a delay until a specific element appears with the **Wait for window content** action. In the figure below, the action waits until a selected UI element **Start button** appears in its disabled (inactive) state.

![Screenshot of wait for window content action properties.](\media\wait\wait-for-window-content-example.png)

This action works similarly to the **Wait for web page content** action, where a UI element is expected to appear on or disappear from a webpage instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Wait actions do not pause the flow, they simply do not move on to the next action until the specified number of seconds in the action properties elapses.
