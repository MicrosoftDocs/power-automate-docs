# Word actions

The Word automation feature enables you to seamlessly interact with Word files stored either locally or in the cloud. To begin, you need to create a Word instance using either the 'Launch Word' or 'Attach to running Word' action. This instance serves as the input parameter for the rest of the actions in the group, allowing you to easily perform actions on the desired Word file.

Currently, the below actions are available:

* **Launch Word:** When this action is triggered in Power Automate for desktop, it opens a Word document and creates a Word instance that can be used in subsequent Word actions within the same desktop flow. The user can choose to open either a new, blank Word document or an existing one located on the local machine or in the cloud (through OneDrive or SharePoint). Depending on the action's configuration, the Word application can be launched visibly or invisibly, and the document can be opened in read-only mode. It's important to note that if the document is opened in read-only mode, it can't be edited either through Power Automate for desktop actions or manually.
* **Attach to running Word:** This action provides the capability to attach an existing Word document that's currently open and creates a Word instance that can be used in subsequent Word actions within the same desktop flow. The user has the option to insert a Word document that's already open on the same machine at the time of design through a drop-down menu, or select an existing Word document located on the local machine or in the cloud (through OneDrive or SharePoint).
* **Save Word:** This action enables the user to save a Word document in any format that currently the Word application supports. The default document format is 'Default (From Extension)' which means that the user must set the document format in the **Document path** parameter, such as set the value to *C:\TestWord.pdf* to save it as PDF.
* **Close Word:** This action closes a Word document and make the specific Word instance in Power Automate as inactive. The user can save the Word document before closing it in any format that currently the Word application supports. Note that the default document format is 'Default (From Extension)' which means that the user must set the document format in the 'Document path' parameter, such as set the value to *C:\TestWord.pdf* to save it as PDF.
* **Read from Word document:** This action enables users to retrieve content from a Word document and use it in a subsequent action of the flow. You have the flexibility to read the entire document, specific pages, or the content of a bookmark. For pages, you can specify a specific page or a list of pages. For example, you can insert the value *2-5* in the respective **Pages** parameter to retrieve the content of pages two to five, for example pages 2, 3, 4, and 5, or insert the value *3,5,6,7* to retrieve the content of the respective pages or use a combination of both ways, such as *2-4,6,8,9*. It's important to note that the Word document format can't be retrieved, and the output parameter is in plain text.

* **Find and replace words in Word document:** Users can apply a new functionality with this action, which is the ability to find and replace specific text within a Word document. Users have the option to replace only the first occurrence of the text or all matches. Additionally, the use of wildcards allows for dynamic text finding, with the wildcard being inserted in the **Text to find** input parameter. To further refine the search, configure the tool to match the case of the text or match whole words only. These settings are available when the **Use wildcards** parameter is set to off.
:::image type="content" source="media/word/findandreplaceword.png" alt-text="Screenshot of action to find a text and replace it in a Word instance":::
* **Write to Word document:** This action enables users to insert text in specific positions within a Word document. This can be done at the beginning or end of the file, or before or after a specific bookmark. Additionally, users have the option to append a new line before the inserted text or not, depending on their preferences.
:::image type="content" source="media/word/writeword.png" alt-text="Screenshot of action to write in a Word instance":::
* **Insert image in Word document:** This action allows users to insert images in specific positions within a Word document. This can be done at the beginning or end of the file, before or after a specific bookmark, or before or after specific text. Note that no spaces or new lines are added. Users have the option to retrieve the image either as a file stored in their local machine or as content from the clipboard.

## Known limitations

### Using Word files synchronized through OneDrive or SharePoint

Interaction with Microsoft Word files that are contained in folders synchronized in OneDrive or SharePoint might result in an erroneous flow. Power Automate for desktop utilizes COM objects for Word interactions. OneDrive and SharePoint aren't fully compatible with Word instances launched through COM.

For this reason, when you try to open a Word file stored in a OneDrive or SharePoint directory, you might encounter a **file not found** error. To resolve this issue, use one of the following workarounds:

#### Workaround 1

* Make a local copy of the respective Word file.
* Modify the local copy of the Word file using Power Automate for desktop Word automation actions.
* Override the Word file copy synchronized through OneDrive or Sharepoint with the local copy that includes the latest changes.

#### Workaround 2

* Open a new Word instance using the **Run application** action. Make sure that you provide enough wait time between actions, allowing the Word process to load completely, including any add-ins.
* Use the action **Attach to running Word** to attach to the new process.

>[!NOTE]
> This workaround can be used in general when the **Launch Word** action fails to execute.
