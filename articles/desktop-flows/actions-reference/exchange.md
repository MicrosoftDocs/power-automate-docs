# Exchange Server actions

> [!WARNING]
> This group of actions is intended for Exchange Server automation scenarios. To automate Exchange Online, use the corresponding Office 365 cloud connectors in cloud flows.

The Exchange Server actions enable you to connect to an Exchange server and manage your correspondence.

Exchange Server actions require a connection to an Exchange server that you can establish using the **Connect to Exchange server** action.

The following example contains a manually populated server address rather than using auto-discovery. The credentials are set to **user defined**, so the domain, username, and password are manually entered. A set timeout in the **Advanced** section allows the action to return an error if a connection hasn't been established within the specified time frame.

To retrieve emails from an exchange server, use the **Retrieve Exchange email messages** action. The following example retrieves email messages from a custom folder named **Receipts**. The filters contain variables that have been previously defined in the desktop flow. The action will save all attachments locally to the specified folder.

The **Process Exchange email messages** action processes email messages retrieved by the **Retrieve Exchange email messages** action. Use this action to move, delete, or mark email messages as read.
