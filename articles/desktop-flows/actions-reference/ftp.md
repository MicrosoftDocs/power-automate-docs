# FTP

Use the FTP action group to upload and download files and manipulate directories on FTP servers.

To establish an FTP connection, use the **Open FTP connection** action. The following example has a specified host, port, and credentials. Additionally, the set timeout makes the action fail if the connection isn't established on time.
