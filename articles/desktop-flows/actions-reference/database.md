# Database actions

To connect to a database, use the **Open SQL connection** action. A connection string specifies all information necessary to connect to a database, such as the driver, the database, server names, and the username and password.

The following connection string connects to an Excel database:

```Connection string
Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\myFolder\myExcelFile.xlsx;Extended Properties="Excel 12.0 Xml;HDR=YES";
```

The following connection string connects to an Access database:

```Connection string
Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\myFolder\myAccessFile.accdb; Persist Security Info=False;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Power Automate for desktop is a 64-bit application, only 64-bit installed drivers are available for selection in the **Open SQL connection** action.

## Configure a connection string manually

To manually build a connection string:

1. Select **Build connections string** to open the **Data Link Properties** dialog. The data link tool helps you compose the required connection string step by step.

2. Once you access the wizard, select the correct driver for the database under **Provider**.

3. Next, under the **Connection** tab, enter the remaining details such as the server name, the username, password, and database name. Select **Test Connection** to test that the connection string connects successfully.

4. Specify a connection timeout and other network settings in the **Advanced** tab.

## <a name="executesqlstatement"></a> Execute SQL statement

Connect to a database and execute a SQL statement.

To execute an SQL query, use the **Execute SQL statement** action. Begin by providing a valid connection to the respective database. Select the desired option in the **Get connection by** property. You can either provide an **SQL connection variable** (you can create one by using the **Open SQL connection** action) or by providing the **Connection string**. Then input the SQL query you want to execute in the **SQL statement** property. You can also modify the timeout seconds of the action or leave the default option (30 seconds).

## Natural language to script powered by copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Natural language to script is a new copilot capability added in Power Automate for desktop. It lets you quickly generate scripts used in the execute SQL statement action by providing a description in natural language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

### Availability by region

Currently, natural language to script in Power Automate for desktop is only available in environments located in the United States.

### Availability by account type

Currently, natural language to script in Power Automate for desktop is only available for users with a work or school account.

> [!NOTE]
> If your environment is in the region where this feature is available and you still can't experience the copilot in Power Automate for desktop experience, contact your tenant administrator. They might have turned off the copilot functionality.

### How to generate scripts using copilot and natural language

To generate SQL code in the execute SQL statement select  **Generate script with Copilot**.

:::image type="content" source="media\scripting\sql_action1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the execute SQL statement action with the Generate script with Copilot button highlighted":::

The create prompt screen opens where you type your natural language prompt.

:::image type="content" source="media\scripting\sql_action2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the execute SQL statement action with the prompt dialog open":::

To create a SQL script, write your prompt and select **Generate**. If you need to re-create it, you can change the prompt and select **Regenerate**. Otherwise, select **Use this script** to go back to the main action window, where you can modify your prompt and add any necessary variables.

### Help us improve this feature

Send feedback by selecting the thumb up or thumb down icon underneath the AI-generated content. Once you do, a feedback dialog appears, which you can use to submit feedback to Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> If you can't see the dialog, your tenant admin might have turned it off. More information: [Disabling the user feedback functionality](#disabling-the-user-feedback-functionality)

### Disabling the user feedback functionality

As a tenant admin you can prevent your users from sending feedback to Microsoft by disabling the `disableSurveyFeedback` tenant setting. Find more information about viewing and setting tenant settings here:

- [List tenant settings (preview)](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/set-tenantsettings)
- [Set TenantSettings](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/set-tenantsettings)

### Data subject rights requests on user feedback

Tenant administrators can view, export, and delete the feedback provided by their users by signing in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), and then selecting **Health** > **Product feedback**.
