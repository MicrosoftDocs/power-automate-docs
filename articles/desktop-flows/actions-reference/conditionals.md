## Getting started with conditionals

Conditional actions allow you to modify which actions to run, based on the outcomes of conditional statements.

Useful applications and features:
* Use the If group of conditionals to evaluate any type of condition.
* Use the Switch group of conditionals to compare a single variable with multiple possible values.
* Cover multiple scenarios by employing nested conditionals.
* Provide default and alternative behaviors to flows based on the available data.

You can find more information on how to use the conditional actions [here](../use-conditionals.md)
