# Conditional actions

Conditional actions allow you to adjust which actions to run based on the outcomes of conditional statements.

The following list displays some applications and features:

* Use **If** conditionals to evaluate any type of condition.
* Use **Switch** conditionals to compare a single variable with multiple possible values.
* Cover multiple scenarios by employing nested conditionals.
* Provide default and alternative behaviors to your desktop flows based on the available data.

To find more information on how to use the conditionals,go to [Use conditionals](../use-conditionals.md).

## <a name="case"></a> Case

An expression that, if met, a block of actions associated with that particular case runs.

### Input parameters

|Argument|Optional|Accepts|Default Value|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Operator|N/A|Equal to (=), Not equal to (<>), Greater than (>), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than (<), Less than or equal to (<=), Contains, Does not contain, Is empty, Is not empty, Starts with, Does not start with, Ends with, Does not end with, Is blank, Is not blank|Equal to (=)|The comparison operator of this case|
|Value to compare|No|*||Enter a value to compare with the switch-block value|

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="case_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="casedefault"></a> Default case

A block of actions that is run, if no case expression has been met in the switch body.

##### Input parameters
This action doesn't require any input.

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="casedefault_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="else"></a> Else

Marks the beginning of a block of actions that ran if the condition specified in the preceding 'If' statements aren't met.

### Input parameters

This action doesn't require any input.

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="else_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="elseif"></a> Else if

Marks the beginning of a block of actions that run if the conditions specified in the preceding 'If' statements aren't met, but the condition specified in this statement is met.

|First operand|No|*||Enter a value name defined by a previous action, text, number or expression to compare with the second operand.|
|Second operand|No|*||Enter a value name produced by a previous action, text, number or expression to compare with the first operand.|

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="elseif_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="if"></a> If
