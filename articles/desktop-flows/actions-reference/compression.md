# Compression actions

To compress (or zip) a file, use the **ZIP files** action and specify a path to archive. If the archive already exists, the action will add the selected files.

The following example uses a variable to specify the path to archive. **Best compression** ensures maximum file size reduction, and a password adds a layer of security to the archive.

:::image type="content" source="media/compression/zip-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ZIP files action.":::

The **Unzip files** action works similarly, requiring a path to archive and a destination folder. The following example uses the **Include mask** option to only unzip files with the extensions **.txt** and **.xlsx**.

## <a name="zipfiles"></a> ZIP files

Compress one or more files or folders into a ZIP archive.

|Compression level|N/A|None, Best speed, Best balance of speed and compression, Best compression|Best balance of speed and compression|The level of compression to use. The higher the compression the smaller the file, though it takes longer to create or access|
|Password|Yes|Direct encrypted input or [Text value](../variable-data-types.md#text-value)||The password to use for protecting the ZIP. Leave this attribute blank to create a non password-protected ZIP|
