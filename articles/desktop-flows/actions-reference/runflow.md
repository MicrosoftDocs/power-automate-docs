# Run desktop flow action

The **Run desktop flow** action enables you to call other desktop flows while running a specific desktop flow. To use the action, add it to the workspace and select the desktop flow you want to call. If the called flow contains input variables, the action will prompt you to enter their values.

You can disable the toggle property 'Wait for flow to complete', which is enabled by default. If disabled, the invoked desktop flow runs concurrently with the parent flow. This configuration is useful for scenarios where unexpected popups in the target application block the parent flow. By running a child flow in parallel, you can monitor and manage these popups, ensuring the parent flow continues smoothly. This improvement provides a workaround given the current concurrency policy, which allows only one flow per machine at a time.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Only one parallel flow can run at this time. If a second child flow runs in parallel, an error occurs during runtime.
> - If a child flow runs in parallel, its output variables are ignored. The variables produced from the 'Run desktop flow' actions aren't shown in the action modal.
> - Child flows can't run another child flow in parallel. A parallel flow run is allowed only if invoked directly from the parent (root) flow.

To find more information about how to use the **Run desktop flow** action, go to [Run desktop flow from other desktop flows](../how-to/run-desktop-flow-action.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> - A flow's dependencies can't be more than 150 other flows.
> - Two flows can't directly or indirectly call one-another as this causes a recursion.
> - In org tenants, the flows must be under the same environment.

## <a name="runflow"></a> Run desktop flow

|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Desktop flow|No|Desktop flow||Select the desktop flow to run from within this flow. The called flow always runs in the same Windows session as the parent flow.|
|Wait for flow to complete|N/A|[Boolean value](../variable-data-types.md#boolean-value)|True|If enabled, this desktop flow waits for the invoked desktop flow to complete before resuming. The invoked desktop flow's output variables are available to the current flow. If disabled, the invoked desktop flow runs concurrently, and its output variables are ignored.|

### Variables produced

This action produces the output variables of the selected flow.
