# Run desktop flow action

The **Run desktop flow** action enables you to call other desktop flows while running a specific desktop flow. To use the action, add it to the workspace and select the desktop flow you want to call. If the called flow contains input variables, the action will prompt you to enter their values.

To find more information about how to use the **Run desktop flow** action, go to [Run desktop flow from other desktop flows](../how-to/run-desktop-flow-action.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> - A flow's dependencies can't be more than 150 other flows.
> - Two flows can't directly or indirectly call one-another as this causes a recursion.
> - In org tenants, the flows must be under the same environment.
