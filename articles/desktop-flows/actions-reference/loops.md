# Loop actions

Use loops to automate repetitive sections of your desktop flows and avoid running the same actions multiple times.

The following list presents some useful applications and features of loops:

* Use simple loops to perform a specific number of repetitions and iterate through data.
* Deploy **Loop condition** to repeat actions until a condition is met.
* Iterate through the items of a list using **For each** loops.
* Explicitly end loops when required.

To find more information on how to use loops, go to [Use loops](../use-loops.md).

## <a name="break"></a> Exit loop

Terminates the loop and the flow resumes at the next action or statement following the loop.

### Input parameters

This action doesn't require any input.

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="break_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="foreach"></a> For each

Iterates over items in a list, data table or data row, allowing a block of actions to be executed repeatedly.

### Input parameters

|Argument|Optional|Accepts|Default Value|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Value to iterate|No|*||Enter a list, data row, or data table value to iterate through it.|

### Variables produced

|Argument|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
||*|The value name that will store the current item value in each iteration.|

### <a name="foreach_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="loop"></a> Loop

Iterates a block of actions for a specified number of times

### Input parameters

|Argument|Optional|Accepts|Default Value|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Start from|No|[Numeric value](../variable-data-types.md#numeric-value)||Set the starting point of the loop counter.|
|Increment by|No|[Numeric value](../variable-data-types.md#numeric-value)||Set the increment that the loop counter variable is increased by.|
|End to|No|[Numeric value](../variable-data-types.md#numeric-value)||Set the ending point of the loop counter.|

### Variables produced

|Argument|Type|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|
||*|The value name that will store the current index, starting at the start from value. The value will change by the increment with each iteration.|

### <a name="loop_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="while"></a> Loop condition

Iterates a block of actions as long as a specified condition proves to be true.

### Input parameters

|Argument|Optional|Accepts|Default Value|Description|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Operator|N/A|Equal to (=), Not equal to (<>), Greater than (>), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than (<), Less than or equal to (<=)|Equal to (=)|Choose the relationship of first operand to second operand.|
|First operand|No|*||Enter a value name defined by a previous action, text, number or expression to compare with the second operand.|
|Second operand|No|*||Enter a value name produced by a previous action, text, number or expression to compare with the first operand.|

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="while_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.

## <a name="continue"></a> Next loop

Forces the next iteration of the block to take place, skipping any actions in between.

### Input parameters

This action doesn't require any input.

### Variables produced

This action doesn't produce any variables.

### <a name="continue_onerror"></a> Exceptions

This action doesn't include any exceptions.
