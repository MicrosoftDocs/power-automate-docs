# OCR actions

Power Automate enables users to read, extract, and manage data within files through optical character recognition (OCR).

To create an OCR engine and extract text from images and documents, use the **Extract text with OCR** action. The following example extracts text from the entire specified image.  

![Screenshot of the Extract text with OCR action.](media/ocr/extract-text-ocr-example.png)

All OCR actions can create a new OCR engine variable or use an existing one. You can use existing OCR engine variables in any action that offers OCR capabilities.

Power Automate supports the Windows OCR and Tesseract engines. To configure the selected OCR engine, navigate to the **OCR engine settings** of the appropriate action. The available options include the language and the image width and height multipliers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - All the available OCR engines are pre-installed in Power Automate and work locally without connecting to the cloud. However, you may need to download language packs or data files to extract texts in specific languages.  
> - Image multipliers increase the image size to make searching and text extraction more effective. Setting values greater than three may lead to erroneous results.

## Use the Windows OCR engine

The default OCR engine in Power Automate is the Windows OCR engine. To extract texts using the Windows OCR engine, you must install the appropriate language pack for the language you want to extract.

If the appropriate language pack isn't installed, Power Automate throws an error, prompting you to install it. To find more information regarding downloading and installing language packs, go to [Language packs for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/language-packs-for-windows-a5094319-a92d-18de-5b53-1cfc697cfca8).

After installing the appropriate language pack, extend the **OCR engine settings** of the OCR action and select the language you want. The Windows OCR engine supports 25 languages, including Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Cyrillic and Latin), Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.

## Use the Tesseract OCR engine

> [!NOTE]
> To make use of the Tesseract OCR engine, make sure the machine's CPU supports AVX2 instruction set.

Apart from the Windows OCR engine, Power Automate supports the Tesseract engine. This engine can extract text in five languages without further configuration: English, German, Spanish, French, and Italian.

To extract text in a language outside the mentioned list, enable the **Use other languages** option in the **OCR engine settings** of the OCR action. When this option is enabled, the action displays two more parameters: **Language abbreviation** and **Language data path**.

The **Language abbreviation** field indicates to the engine which language to look for during OCR. The **Language data path** field contains the language data files (.traineddata) used to train the OCR engine. You can find the language data files for all the available languages in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata).

You can also use the Tesseract engine to extract text from multilingual documents. To find more information regarding extracting text from multilingual documents, go to [Perform OCR on multilingual documents](../how-to/ocr-multilingual-documents.md).
