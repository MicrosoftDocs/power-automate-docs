# Folder actions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent unauthorized access, Windows require administrator rights to access protected folders. To access these resources using the folder actions, run Power Automate with administrator rights. For more information about running Power Automate as an administrator, go to [Run Power Automate with elevated rights](../setup.md#run-power-automate-with-elevated-rights).

Power Automate folder actions enable you to manipulate and organize folders.

The **Get special folder** action retrieves the paths for commonly used directories that vary among users and machines. The following example retrieves the desktop directory and stores it in a variable.

You can now use the **%SpecialFolderPath%** variable any time it's necessary, regardless of the user who runs the flow or the computer on which it runs.

Create new folders with the **Create folder** action.

To get a list of a folder's contents, use the **Get subfolders in folder** action. This action retrieves a list of folders located within the specified folder. The following example retrieves all the subfolders of a specified special folder. In the **Advanced** section, you can see that the action sorts the results by creation time in ascending order and name in descending order.

You can also copy, move, rename, and delete or empty folders using the appropriate actions.
