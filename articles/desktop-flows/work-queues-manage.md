# Manage work queues

Power Automate provides rich user experiences and features that allow you to efficiently and centrally manage work queues within your environments.

## View work queues

To view the list of work queues:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.
2. On the left menu, select the **Monitor** section.
3. Select **Work queue**.

If you have already created work queues or if any work queue has been shared with you, you see a list similar to the below.

## Create a work queue

To create a work queue:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.
2. On the left menu, select the **Monitor** section.
3. Select **Work queue** and then select **+ New work queue**.
4. In the **New work queue** side panel, enter a **work queue name** for the queue.
5. (Optional) Enter a **description** for the work queue.
6. (Optional) Enter a **work queue key** for the work queue. When provided, the value must be unique within this queue. If left empty, a unique value is automatically provided by the system.
7. (Optional) Activate this section and select a default lifespan value for work queue items in the **Items expire after** fields.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you set an *Items expire after* value for a work queue, any item added without an explicit expiration date will expire after the entered *Items expire value* has elapsed. So if you set the *Items expire after* to 30 minutes, an item added at 2:00 PM will expire at 2:30 PM.
8. (Optional) Select either JSON or XSD as the schema type for work queue item input validation to ensure that input data conforms to the defined schema. Next, select **Add schema** to enter or paste the desired schema.
   > [!NOTE]
   > - Once a schema is added to a work queue, it can't be changed to avoid data inconsistencies and processing failures.
   > - Currently supported JSON schema version is draft 3.

### Work queue item statuses

| Status             | Purpose                                                                           | When to Use                                                                                  | Example                                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Queued             | The item is waiting to be picked up for processing.                               | When the item is ready to be processed. This status is the default when adding items to a work queue. | An invoice was received and added to the processing queue.   |
| Processing         | A system or a human is currently processing the item.                             | When the item is actively being worked on.                                                   | A customer service representative is working on resolving a customer complaint. |
| On hold            | The item is temporarily paused and isn't available for processing.                | When additional information is required or a dependent task needs to be completed.           | An order is on hold because the payment confirmation is pending from the customer. |
| Processed          | The item is successfully processed and completed.                                 | Use this status to indicate that the work on the item finished successfully.                 | A customer refund was processed and confirmed.               |
| Generic exception  | The item encountered an unspecified, unexpected error or issue during processing. | When an unexpected error occurs that doesn't fit into other more specific exception statuses. | An unexpected system error caused an order processing to fail. |
| IT exception       | The item encountered a technical error or IT-related issue during processing.     | When processing is interrupted by a technical failure, such as a server error or connectivity issue. | An order processing failed due to a network or database server outage. |
| Business exception | The item encountered a business rule-related issue during processing.             | When processing fails due to a business logic error or violation, such as incorrect data input. | A vendor invoice is rejected because the vendor sending the invoice is blocked. |
| Processing timeout | The item failed to complete processing within the allocated time limit.           | When processing takes longer than the predefined time frame for the work queue.              | A data extraction process from a remote application is taking longer than the set timeout limit. |

### Allowed status transitions

Status transitions rules have been established in order to optimize the lifecycle management of work queue items. As a result, certain work queue item statuses might be unavailable for selection either interactively or during runtime processing if they don't fall under the allowed transition path. More information about these paths is in the following table.

| Status      | Details                                                                                           | Allowed transitions |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Queued**      | This is the default state when items enter the work queue, and the only state under which work queue item dequeuing is allowed. | Processing          |
| **Processing**  | Indicating that the item is currently being processed.                                       | Processed, Exception|
| **Processed**   | Indicating that the item is currently processing.                                             | Queued, On hold     |
| **Exception**   | An exception has been raised during work item processing. Depending on your exception scenarios, you have the option to choose between **Generic**, **IT, and **Business** **exceptions**.                                 | Queued, On hold     |
| **On hold**    | A business or IT user has picked an item to review, assess, and potentially remediate issues.     | Queued              |
