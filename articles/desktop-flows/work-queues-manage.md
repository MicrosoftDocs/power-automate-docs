# Manage work queues

Power Automate provides rich user experiences and features that allow you to efficiently and centrally manage work queues within your environments.

## View work queues

To view the list of work queues:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.
2. On the left menu, select the **Monitor** section.
3. Select **Work queue**.

If you have already created work queues or if any work queue has been shared with you, you see a list similar to the below.

## Create a work queue

To create a work queue:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.
2. On the left menu, select the **Monitor** section.
3. Select **Work queue** and then select **+ New work queue**.
4. In the **New work queue** side-panel, enter a **name** for the work queue.
5. (Optional) Enter a **description** for the work queue.
6. (Optional) Enter a default lifespan value for work queue items in the **Items expire after** field.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you set an *Items expire after* value for a work queue, any item added without an explicit expiration date will expire after the entered *Items expire value* has elapsed. So if you set the *Items expire after* to 30 minutes, an item added at 2:00 PM will expire at 2:30 PM.

## Edit a work queue item

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To help protect data integrity during processing, work queue item names or values aren't allowed to be changed for items that are in the **Processing** state.

To edit a work queue item:

1. Select the work queue item you would like to edit and then select  **Edit work queue item** .
2. In the **Edi work queue item** side-panel, you can update all values as long as the item isn't in the **Processing** state.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you don't provide a value for the work queue item name, the internal work queue id is displayed instead in the work queue item list pages.

### Allowed status transitions

Status transitions rules have been established in order to optimize the lifecycle management of work queue items. As a result, certain work queue item statuses might be unavailable for selection either interactively or during runtime processing if they don't fall under the allowed transition path. More information about these paths is in the following table.

| Status      | Details                                                                                           | Allowed transitions |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Queued**      | This is the default state when items enter the work queue, and the only state under which work queue item dequeuing is allowed. | Processing          |
| **Processing**  | Indicating that the item is currently being processed.                                       | Processed, Exception|
| **Processed**   | Indicating that the item is currently processing.                                             | Queued, On hold     |
| **Exception**   | An exception has been raised during work item processing. Depending on your exception scenarios, you have the option to choose between **Generic**, **IT** and **Business** **exceptions**.                                 | Queued, On hold     |
| **On hold**    | A business or IT user has picked an item to review, assess, and potentially remediate issues.     | Queued              |
