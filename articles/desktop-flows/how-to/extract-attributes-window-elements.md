# Extract attributes from window elements

The **Get details of a UI element in window** action enables users to retrieve the values of various attributes that window elements may have.

These values can be used in various operations, such as [managing windows by their handles](identify-window-handle.md) and [closing windows through their process IDs](close-window-process-id.md).

Apart from the four predefined attributes that the action provides, you also retrieve the following attributes:
