# Automate Java applications

Currently, Power Automate for desktop supports the use of UI automation in all Java apps and applets for the following Java versions:

- Java apps: Java version 7 and above.
- Java applets: Java version 7 and version 8.

The following sections include information for enabling the UI automation in Java applets.

## Installing Java configuration

In order to automate Java applications, particular settings must be in place. 

To install the Java configuration manually, after Power Automate for desktop has been installed, navigate to the installation folder (**C:\Program Files (x86)\Power Automate Desktop**) and run the **PAD.Java.Installer.exe** as an administrator. 

Logs for Java automation with Power Automate for desktop can be found in the **%temp%/ java_automation_log** folder (for example, **C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\java_automation_log**). 

## Utilization of the default UI automation instead of Java UI automation 

Το prevent the [recorder](../recording-flow.md) and the [UI element picker](../ui-elements.md) from recognizing Java elements built with the SWT framework and make them work with the default desktop UI elements: 

- Edit the configuration file located under the machine’s Program Files: **Power Automate Desktop\Microsoft.Flow.RPA.Desktop.UIAutomation.Plugin.Java.dll.config**.
- Set the **BlockSwt** property to **true**. 

## Uninstalling Java configuration

To uninstall the Java configuration (revert all changes applied to the machine by the Java installer): 

1. Launch the Command Line tool (cmd) 

1. Run the following command: 

    ``` CMD
    PAD.Java.Installer.exe -u 
    ```

## Troubleshooting 

If you come across any issues while automating Java applications, there are multiple potential causes. Learn more in [Can't access the elements of a Java application](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/desktop-flows/cannot-access-java-application-elements).
