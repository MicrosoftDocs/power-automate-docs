# Upgrade/downgrade Power Automate

This article offers guidance on upgrading or downgrading Power Automate for desktop and the machine runtime app, and addresses compatibility concerns.

## Upgrade Power Automate 

Learn how to [install Power Automate](../install.md) and [install Power Automate silently](../install-silently.md).  
[Manage manual updates and update notifications](../console.md#update-power-automate-for-desktop) through the Power Automate for desktop Console and machine-runtime app.  
To prevent users from manually updating Power Automate and receiving update notifications, use [this registry entry](../governance.md#prevent-users-manually-updating-power-automate-for-desktop). 

## Backward compatibility

Power Automate maintains backwards compatibility, ensuring that users who upgrade to the latest version retain functionality and access to their previous work. The newer versions of the software are designed to operate seamlessly with desktop flows created with older versions. 
**Desktop flows** are stored in the **Process** Dataverse table and **remain unaffected by software upgrades**.  
Each desktop flow is associated with the version of Power Automate for desktop with which it was created or modified. For a desktop flow version to be updated, it must be edited and re-saved with a different software version.  


> [!NOTE]
> - This workaround applies only to desktop flows saved in v2 Dataverse [schema](../schema.md).
> - Learn more about size limit related errors during flow save at [Exceeded size limit](../schema.md#exceeded-size-limit).

To remove all UI element screenshots of desktop flows within a solution:

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. Go toâ€¯**Solutions**.
1. Select the solution that contains one or more desktop flows.
1. Select all items with name **Desktop flow ui element screenshot**.
1. Select **Remove** > **Remove from this solution**.
