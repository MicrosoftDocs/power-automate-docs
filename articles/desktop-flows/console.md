# Power Automate console

The console is the central interface of Power Automate for desktop.

The main area of the console has four tabs that show different kinds of information: a home screen, your desktop flows, [shared desktop flows](manage.md#share-desktop-flows), and [built-in examples](create-flow.md#start-creating-desktop-flows-using-examples).

At the top of the window, you see the current user. On the command bar, you see all the available actions, a dropdown list to switch environments, the **Settings** and **Help** buttons, and a search bar.

> [!NOTE]
> Some options in the console might be disabled because of insufficient permissions in the current environment. Contact your admin to grant access or switch to another environment. Learn more about security roles in [Configure user security](/power-platform/admin/database-security).

## Starting a desktop flow

To run a desktop flow as local attended, select the **Start** button next to the selected flow or on the command bar. The **Status** column lets you review the current status of each flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/start-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the status column in the console.":::

If a running flow has [input variables](manage-variables.md#input-and-output-variables), a dialog box prompts you to provide the appropriate values.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/start-flow-inputs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the flow inputs dialog.":::

## Editing a desktop flow

In addition to [creating new desktop flows](create-flow.md), edit existing flows by selecting the **Edit** button next to the selected flow or on the command bar.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/create-edit-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit buttons in the console.":::

Develop new flows and edit existing flows in the flow designer. Learn more about the flow designer and how to develop desktop flows in [Desktop flow designer](flow-designer.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If multiple people change a shared desktop flow, the last person to save it overrides all previous changes.

## Console Settings

To configure Power Automate for desktop, select the **Settings** button.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/console-settings-panel-with-appearence.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console settings pane.":::

Under **Appearance**, choose whether Power Automate works in light mode, dark mode, or follows the system default setting.
:::image type="content" source="media/console/dark-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dark mode experience in Power Automate for desktop.":::

Under **Flow run control**, use the **Monitoring/Notifications** dropdown to choose if Power Automate should display integrated Windows notifications, a custom flow monitoring window, or no notifications. Learn more about Power Automate notifications in [Runtime notifications](runtime-notifications.md).

You can also set a hotkey combination to pause or resume a running flow, and another hotkey to stop running flows instantly.

By default, Power Automate prompts you to confirm triggering a desktop flow via URL or desktop shortcut. Use the **Display confirmation dialog when invoking flows externally** option to disable this functionality. You can find more information about external links in [Run desktop flows via URL or desktop shortcuts](run-desktop-flows-url-shortcuts.md).  

To decide whether Microsoft collects diagnostic data to improve user experience, go to the **Data collection** settings tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only admins can change the data collection settings.

## Desktop flow properties

To review the properties of a desktop flow, right-click it and select **Properties**, or choose the same option from the corresponding shortcut. In the **General** tab, you can edit the name and description of the flow, set up a keyboard shortcut to trigger the flow locally, manage the **Tags (preview)** associated with the flow, define the **On error** behavior of the flow run, and determine whether the desktop flow should **time out** after a set period.

[**Tags (preview)**](tags.md) are labels that can be applied to desktop flows, to group and associate them together in an easy and straightforward way.

If the **Add screenshot to logs** option is enabled, a screenshot is captured when a flow run fails and is uploaded to the [flow run action details](monitor-run-details.md#actions-details).

The **Flow timeout** property is disabled by default. If it is enabled, specify the maximum time the flow can run. If that maximum duration limit is reached during (console or cloud initiated) runtime, the desktop flow is forced to stop and time out. You can use the proposed timeout value, or provide your own using a combination of an integer value with the preferred time unit (seconds, minutes, or hours).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Access to the flow run logs is a premium feature, which requires a [Power Automate subscription](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/pricing/).
> - The **Tags (preview)** functionality and the **Flow timeout** property are only available for users with a work or school account.
> - The **Tags (preview)** functionality, as well as the **Add screenshot to logs** and **Flow timeout** properties, apply only to flows stored in [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md).

In the **Details** tab, you can see the owner, the creation and last modification dates, the flow ID and the flowâ€™s storage schema version in Dataverse. For more information on the enhanced desktop flows schema, go to [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md).

Additionally, the **Run URL** lets you run the flow through various sources, such as browsers, the Windows Run application, and the Command Prompt. You can find more information regarding this functionality in [Run desktop flows via URL or desktop shortcuts](run-desktop-flows-url-shortcuts.md).
