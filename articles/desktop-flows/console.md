# Power Automate console

The console is the central interface of Power Automate for desktop.

The main area of the console contains four tabs that display different kind of information: a home screen, your desktop flows, [shared desktop flows](manage.md#share-desktop-flows), and [built-in examples](create-flow.md#start-creating-desktop-flows-using-examples).

On the top of the window, you can see the current user, while on the command bar, you can see all the available actions, a dropdown list to switch environments, the **Settings** and **Help** buttons, and a search bar.

> [!NOTE]
> Some options in the console may be disabled due to insufficient permissions in the current environment. Contact your administrator to grant you access or switch to another environment. To find more information about security roles, go to [Configure user security](/power-platform/admin/database-security).

## Starting a desktop flow

To run a desktop flow as local attended, use the **Start** button next to the selected flow or on the command bar. The **Status** column allows you to review the current status of each flow.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/start-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the status column in the console.":::

If a running flow contains [input variables](manage-variables.md#input-and-output-variables), a dialog box prompts you to provide the appropriate values.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/start-flow-inputs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the flow inputs dialog.":::

## Editing a desktop flow

Apart from [creating new desktop flows](create-flow.md), you can edit existing flows using the **Edit** button next to the selected flow or on the command bar.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/create-edit-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the edit buttons in the console.":::

The development of new flows and the editing of existing flows occur in the flow designer. To find more information regarding the flow designer and how to develop desktop flows, refer to [Desktop flow designer](flow-designer.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> When more than one person changes a shared desktop flow, the last person who saves the flow overrides all previous actions.

## Console Settings

To configure Power Automate for desktop to your liking, select the **Settings** button.

:::image type="content" source="media/console/console-settings-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console settings pane":::

Under the **Application** category, select whether Power Automate should launch automatically and whether closing the console also closes the application. You can also set a hotkey combination to stop running flows instantly.

Using the **Monitoring/Notifications** dropdown list, you can choose whether Power Automate displays integrated Windows notifications, a custom monitoring window, or no notifications at all. To find more information regarding Power Automate notifications, go to [Runtime notifications](runtime-notifications.md).

By default, Power Automate always prompts you to confirm the triggering of a desktop flow via URL or desktop shortcut. The **Display confirmation dialog when invoking flows externally** option allows you to disable this functionality. You can find more information about external links in [Run desktop flows via URL or desktop shortcuts](run-desktop-flows-url-shortcuts.md).  

To decide whether Microsoft should collect diagnostic data to improve user experience, navigate to the **Data collection** settings tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only admins can change data collection settings.

## Desktop flow properties

To review the properties of a desktop flow, right-click on it and select **Properties**. In the **General** tab, you can edit the name and description of the flow, set up a keyboard shortcut to trigger the flow locally, and define the **On error** behavior of the flow run.

If the **Add screenshot to logs** option is enabled, a screenshot is captured upon flow run failure and is uploaded to the [flow run action details](monitor-run-details.md#actions-details).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Access to the flow run logs is a premium feature, which requires a [Power Automate subscription](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/pricing/).
> - The **Add screenshot to logs** property applies only to flows stored in [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md).

In the **Details** tab, you can see the owner, the creation and last modification dates, the flow ID and the flow’s storage schema version in Dataverse. For more information on the enhanced desktop flows schema, go to [Power Automate v2 schema](schema.md).

Additionally, there's the **Run URL** that you can use to run the flow through many different sources, such as browsers, the Windows Run application, and the Command Prompt. You can find more information regarding this functionality in [Run desktop flows via URL or desktop shortcuts](run-desktop-flows-url-shortcuts.md).

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Generate a flow description for flows that you own or are a co-owner by the press of a button. Copilot then analyzes the flow and generates a description for it. This feature is also available from the flow details in make.powerautomate.com. More information: [Manage desktop flows](manage.md)
