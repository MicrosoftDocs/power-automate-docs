# Power Automate Desktop flow console

The flow console is the central interface of Power Automate Desktop.

After signing in, your username will be displayed in the top-right corner, while a list of flows occupies the central pane. At the top right-hand side, a dropdown list allows you to switch environments in order to access different flows; alongside the environments are also the Settings and Help buttons, and a search bar for easily locating flows.

## Starting a cloud flow

Users may run any Power Automate Desktop flows available to them through the console, by hovering the cursor over a cloud flow and pressing the "Start" button. The status of the flow is also displayed:

If the flow contains input variables, a dialog box prompts the user to provide values for each input variable.

## Editing a cloud flow

Through the console, users may also create a new flow by pressing the "New flow" button, or edit an already existing one by double-clicking on it, or hovering the cursor over it and pressing the edit button:

In both scenarios, the flow designer will be launched; this is where flow creation and editing takes place.

## Console Settings

Press the **Settings** button to configure Power Automate Desktop to your liking:

Under the **Application** category, select whether Power Automate Desktop shoult launch automatically, whether closing the console will close the application as well, and whether Power Automate Desktop should be able to display Windows notifications. You may also set a hotkey combination to instantly stop a running flow.

Change the display language, and decide whether Microsoft may collect diagnostic data to improve user experience, under **Application language** and **Data collection**, respectively.

Finally, access and manage your avaliable licenses in the respective category.
