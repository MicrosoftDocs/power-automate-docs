# Manage desktop flows

After creating desktop flows, you might need to view, edit, or check their status. To achieve all these tasks, go to **My flows** > **Desktop flows** in the Power Automate portal.

## See a list with desktop flows

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).

1. Go to **My flows** > **Desktop flows**.

   Using the available options in this tab, you can create new desktop flows and edit or delete existing desktop flows.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete or rename a desktop flow, select the refresh button to reflect the changes in the desktop flows list.

## See details of desktop flows

For each of your desktop flows, you can see its details by selecting its name from the list of desktop flows. You can see various details including:

- The run history with details of each run.
- The applications or websites used in the desktop flow.

Follow these steps to see the details for a desktop flow:

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **My flows** > **Desktop flows**.
1. Select any of your desktop flows.

## Share desktop flows

You can share a desktop flow with other users in your organization, giving those users specific permissions to access your flows.

Follow these steps to share a desktop flow:

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **My flows** > **Desktop flows**.
1. Select the desktop flow you want to share, and then **Share**.
1. Select **Add people**, and then enter the name of the person in your organization with whom you'd like to share the desktop flow.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > You can also enter a Microsoft Dataverse team name instead of the name of the person. If you want to share with a Microsoft Entra group, you first need to create a Microsoft Entra Group team in Dataverse based on the Microsoft Entra Group. More information: [Microsoft Dataverse teams management](/power-platform/admin/manage-teams)
   
5. Select the user and then select either **User** or **Co-owner** as the permission for the person with whom you share the flow.

    - **Co-owner**: This access level gives the co-owner full permissions to the desktop flow. They can edit, share, and delete the desktop flow.
    - **User**: This access level gives permission to only use that desktop flow in a cloud flow and run it locally with Power Automate for desktop. No edit, rename, delete or share permissions are possible with this access. Alternatively, those users can create a copy of the desktop flow using the **Save as** option, and work independently.

6. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Once a desktop flow has been shared, owners and co-owners can change the access of each user by selecting **Manage access** on the desktop flow details page.
> If someone shares a desktop flow with you, select the refresh button to see it in the **Shared with me** flows list.
> After you share a desktop flow with new co-owners, the co-owners see all the desktop runs that happen in the future. However those co-owners don't see the desktop flows already completed before sharing.

## Reassign desktop flows

To reassign a desktop flow to another user:

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **Data** > **Tables**.
1. Go to the **All** tab, and then search for the **Process** table.

1. Select **Edit**.
1. Select your desktop flow in the list, and then select **Edit row using form**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-desktop-flows/manage-desktop-flows-edit-row-using-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit row using form button.":::

1. Select **Assign**, and then confirm the changes.

1. Sign in to the [Power Automate portal](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com).
1. Go to **My flows** > **Desktop flows**.
1. Select the flow you want to copy.
1. Select **Save As**.

## Manage desktop flows access

For each of your desktop flows, you can manage its access by selecting **Manage access** in the desktop flows details page.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-desktop-flows/manage-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage access option.":::

In this page, you can:

- Share the desktop flow with another user.
- Edit users' permissions.
- Remove users' permissions for this desktop flow.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Users of an environment with a Dataverse security role that grants them **Read** access to **all records** in the **Process** table (where different types of flows are stored), will be listed as **Co-owners** of **any desktop flows** created in that environment. They can't be removed as co-owners unless you change privileges and access level in the underlying security role.
> An example of a security role with environment wide **Read** privileges for desktop flows is the **System Customizer** role, which has **Process** table **Read** permission set to **Organization**, which essentially allows users with this role to view all desktop flows in the environment and be marked as co-owner. We therefore highly recommended reviewing each security role before assigning them to users to ensure that the privilege set and access level is appropriate for the intended use case.
> - When a user isn't part of an environment anymore, you can continue to see it as a deactivated user. You're notified in the **Manage access** section of the desktop flow if this flow is shared with deactivated users. In this situation, remove access to them.
