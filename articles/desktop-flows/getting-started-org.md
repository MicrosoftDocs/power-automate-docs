# Getting started with an Organization premium account

Power Automate enables regular and power users alike to create flows that automate routine repetitive tasks. Build flows from pre-made actions, or [record windows and web browser activity in real time](recording-flow.md).

Unlock the full spectrum of RPA features such as premium cloud connectors, the ability to [run your flows automatically](link-pad-flow-portal.md), [detailed monitoring](monitor-desktop-flow-runs.md) and many more. 

Power Automate gives you the option to [share your flows](manage.md#share-desktop-flows) among your colleagues so that you can improve automations and build on top of them.

Access your flows from anywhere, harnessing the power of the cloud to establish a robust and flexible RPA system. Take full advantage of multiple environments to organize and manage usersâ€™ flows. 

If you currently use Power Automate with a work or school account or your license does not include attended RPA, you can still use Power Automate for your desktop automation needs. Start a trial to preview all the features by selecting **Go Premium** on the Power Automate for desktop console.

## Creating a flow

1. Begin by visiting [https://flow.microsoft.com/](https://flow.microsoft.com/) and entering your credentials; then, navigate to **My flows**, and create a new **Desktop flow**:

1. After you assign a name to the flow, you will be prompted to launch Power Automate for desktop; select **Open** to do so.

1. In the flow designer, start building the flow by double-clicking on actions, or dragging them from the actions pane on the left, to the central workspace pane.

1. Expand the **Datetime** category, and select the **Get current date and time** action. Configure it to only retrieve the date:

1. Next, expand the **Text** category, and configure the **Convert datetime to text** actions as follows:

    ![Screenshot of the Convert datetime to text action.](media\getting-started-org\convert-datetime-to-text.png)

    This will ensure that the current date is displayed in a filename-friendly format.

1. Use the **Get special folder** action to retrieve the path of the **Documents** folder:

    ![Screenshot of the Get special folder action.](media\getting-started-org\get-special-folder.png)

1. Add the **If file exists** action from the **Conditionals** category, and configure it to check whether the file "report.xlsx" is present in the Documents folder:

    ![Screenshot of the If file exists action.](media\getting-started-org\if-report-exists.png)

1. Finally, add the current date to the file's name by using the **Rename file(s)** action from the **File** category:

    ![Screenshot of the Rename file action.](media\getting-started-org\rename-report.png)

1. The resulting flow should look like this:

    ![Screenshot of the final flow.](media\getting-started-org\finished-flow.png)

Following this example, it is possible to imagine a wide range of scenarios where Power Automate can be used to automate tasks. The abundance of actions, combined with cloud management capabilities, affords endless possibilities to individual users and organizations.
