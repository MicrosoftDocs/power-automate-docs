# View desktop flows analytics

As an admin, you'll need to view the overall status of automation that runs in your organization. There are three options to monitor the analytics for automation that's built with desktop flows:

1. [Desktop flow activity](desktop-flow-activity.md) (directly in Power Automate)  
1. The Power Platform [admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac). (Note: Local attended runs aren't available in the Power Platform admin center. Users and admins can monitor them with Desktop flow activity at the environment level)
1. The [Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit](/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup).


## Learn more

- Analyze the [desktop flows risk assessment](/power-platform/guidance/coe/power-bi-govern#desktop-flows-risk-assessment) in your environment.
- Run [desktop flows](run-desktop-flow.md).
