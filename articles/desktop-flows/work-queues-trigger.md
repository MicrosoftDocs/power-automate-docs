# Trigger work queues processing

Power Automate provides a [**variety of triggers**](../triggers-introduction.md) that can be used to initiate work queue processing. These triggers can be categorized into different types based on their functionality.

- **Manual Triggers**: These triggers are initiated manually by the user. They're useful when you want to start a flow on-demand, such as when you need to perform a specific task.

- **Automated Triggers**: These triggers are initiated automatically based on a specific event or condition. For example, you can use the "When a new email arrives" trigger to initiate a flow whenever a new email is received.

- **Scheduled Triggers**: These triggers are initiated based on a specific schedule. You can use them to perform tasks at specific times or intervals, such as sending a daily report.

- **Instant Triggers**: These triggers are initiated immediately when a specific event occurs. For example, you can use the "When a file is created or modified" trigger to initiate a flow whenever a file is created or modified in a specific folder.

- **UI-based Triggers**: These triggers are initiated based on user interactions with a user interface. For example, you can use the "When a button is clicked" trigger to initiate a flow when a user select a button on a form.
