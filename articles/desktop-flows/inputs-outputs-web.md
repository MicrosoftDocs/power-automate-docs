# Use inputs and outputs in Selenium IDE flows

You can define inputs to pass to your automated applications during playback. You can also pass *output* from your automated applications to your flow.

## Define inputs for a Web UI flow

Inputs of a UI flow let you pass information from an external source such as a database or another UI flow to the target legacy software that you will automate.

Any variable that is used (read) before initialization (usually done via **store** commands) will be automatically treated as an input variable and it will be displayed on the **Run a UI flow for web** action card.

You can use variables via string interpolation, for example, change the click command's target field to "id=\${elementId}". Or change the type command's value field to "\${inputText}".

The command, **set window size** and the command, **type** in the following screenshots use uninitialized variables \${Width}, \${Height}, and \${search}. These variables will become input values.

![Screenshot of the set window size and type commands.](../media/inputs-outputs-web/set-window-size.png "Set window size and type")

You can use variables directly in some commands, for example, forEach command's target/value fields are both variables, you don't need to surround it with "\${}".

Consult [Selenium commands](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/) reference to determine which commands take variable names directly.

## Define outputs for a Web UI flow

Any variable defined in the selenium script automatically becomes an output value. Use the following commands to declare variables:

[Store](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store)

[Store attribute](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-attribute)

[Store json](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-json)

[Store title](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-title)

[store value](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-value)

[Store window handle](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-window-handle)

[Store xpath count](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#store-xpath-count)

[Execute script](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands/#execute-script)(add 'return' syntax to return the object you want to store at the end of the
script)
