# Process and Unattended RPA capacity utilization (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](actions-reference/includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Process and Unattended RPA capacity utilization page** provides you with insights into how your process capacity (or legacy unattended RPA capacity) is being used within your environment. As a reminder, within the Power Automate platform each process capacity is based on a purchased [Process license](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types) and each legacy unattended RPA capacity is based on an [Unattended RPA add-on](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/add-ons#unattended-rpa-add-on). It's [assigned to the environment](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on#allocate-or-change-capacity-in-an-environment) and allows your machines to run desktop flows autonomously without human interaction in unattended mode. Every capacity allocated to a machine allows it to carry out an additional unattended desktop flow run simultaneously.

[!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

A process capacity, or legacy unattended RPA capacity, can be allocated to a machine.

|Consuming object|Description|Consumption mode|
|----|--------------------|----|
|[Machine](manage-machines.md)|Every capacity allocated to a machine allows it to carry out an additional unattended desktop flow run simultaneously.|Capacity is autoallocated to the machine at unattended desktop flow runtime.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> Process capacity and unattended RPA capacity have been combined in a single capacity pool and have exactly the same role within the Power Automate platform.

## Unattended RPA capacity overview

The **Unattended RPA capacity overview** pie chart helps you understand the capacity consumption within the environment, lets you know if there's still capacity to scale-up in the future, and alerts you when the utilized capacity is exceeding environment capacity (= overage).

|-|Legend|Description|
|----|--------------------|----|
|![Legend color - Used by unattended machines (last 30 days)](media/capacity-utilization/legend-used-by-unattended-machines.png)|Used by unattended machines (last 30 days)|Compliant capacity allocated to machines within the environment.|
|![Legend color - Available capacity](media/capacity-utilization/legend-available-capacity.png)|Available capacity|Available capacity for new unattended machines.|
|![Legend color - Overage utilization](media/capacity-utilization/legend-my-overage-utilization.png)|My overage utilization|Capacity over-allocated to unattended machines within the environment.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> Currently, the chart displays an environment-wide report over capacity consumption and doesn't distinguish one user's machines consumption from another user's machines consumption.

## Process and Unattended RPA capacity insights

The **Unattended capacity insights** card informs you of operation health and gives recommendations when there are compliance issues.

![Unattended capacity insight](media/capacity-utilization/unattended-capacity-insight.png)

|Badge|Message|Insight|
|----|--------------------|----|
|**Sufficient capacity**|There's available capacity for new unattended machines.|Scale-up possible in the future.|
|**Fully utilized**|There's no more capacity for new unattended machines.|The capacity utilization rate is optimal at 100% but there's no room for scaling-up.|
|**Capacity overage**|There's some over-allocated capacity to unattended machines in the environment.|Uncompliant capacity usage exceeding environment capacity.|

## Capacity overage

Capacity overage in an environment occurs when the capacity utilized by unattended machines surpasses the assigned capacity of the environment. To return to compliance, it's important to promptly rectify the situation.

### How to fix process and unattended RPA capacity overage?

When some unattended machines are in overage, the **Fix capacity button** appears in the **Unattended capacity insights** card.

|Fix capacity - Button|
|-------|
|![Fix process capacity button](media/capacity-utilization/fix-process-capacity-button.png)|

It provides corrective actions.

|Fix capacity - Corrective actions|

|![Process fix capacity actions](media/capacity-utilization/unattended-fix-capacity.png)|

The **Request capacity** action submits a request to the tenant administrator for the consideration of assigning capacity to the environment.

|Fix capacity - Request capacity|

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The preset value in the request capacity modal dialog is equal to the total overage value in the environment.
