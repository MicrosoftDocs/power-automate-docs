# Run attended or unattended desktop flows

After you've created and tested a Windows recorder (V1) flow, you can run it from an event, schedule, or button. To make this possible, add your Windows recorder (V1) flow to an [Automated flow](../get-started-logic-flow.md), a [Button flow](../introduction-to-button-flows.md), a [Scheduled flow](../run-scheduled-tasks.md), or a [business process flow](../business-process-flows-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- You need the [on-premises data gateway](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820580&clcid=0x409) for your device to have the desktop flow triggered by Power Automate.
   
   The gateway is an enterprise-grade secure connection between Power Automate and your device (where your desktop flow runs). Power Automate uses the gateway to access your on-premises device so that it can trigger your desktop flows from an event, schedule, or button.
- A work or school account. 

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >You must use the same work or school account to set up the gateway and to sign into Power Automate.
   

## Run your desktop flow from an event, button, schedule, or business process flow

In this example we will use an automated flow to trigger a desktop flow when a new email arrives.

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **My flows** in the left navigation pane.
1. Select **New**, and then select **Automated-from blank**.

   >[!TIP]
   >You can choose any other type of flow to suit your needs.

1. Give your flow a name in the **Flow name** box.
1. Search for "new email", and then select **When a new email arrives (V3)** from the list of triggers. 

   ![Select a trigger.](../media/run-desktop-flow/select-email-trigger.png "Select a trigger")
1. Select **Create**, and then select **New step**.
1. Search for **desktop flows**, and then select **Run a desktop flow for desktop** from the list of **Actions**. 

   ![Search action.](../media/run-desktop-flow/search-action.png "Search action")

1. Provide the gateway information and device credentials. 

   You'll have to do this once per device:

    - **Gateway**: Select the gateway that you created earlier or use **New gateway** to create a new gateway.   
    - **Domain and Username**: Displays the work or school account from the device.
       >[!Important]
        >Make sure you can login to the device using these credentials.  
    - **Password**: Provide your work or school account’s password.

      ![Connection settings.](../media/run-desktop-flow/uiflow-connection-card.png "Connection settings")

      >[!TIP]
      >If you don't see your gateway, you might be in an environment whose region is different from the gateway region. Select **Troubleshoot a missing gateway** in the gateway name list to learn more. You can also confirm your gateway and Power Automate regions are [mapped correctly](../regions-overview.md).

      >[!TIP]
      >If you don't see your gateway, you might need to select a different connection. To do this, select **...** from the top right side of the **Run a UI flow for desktop** or **Run a desktop flow for Web** card, and then select the connection from **My connections**.


      ![Select a new connection.](../media/run-desktop-flow/select-new-connection.png "Select a new connection")

1. Select the desktop flow that you previously created.

   ![Select desktop flow.](../media/run-desktop-flow/select-desktop-flow.png "Select desktop flow")

1. Select **Save** to save your automated flow.
 
    >[!TIP]
    >Before testing, confirm that your gateway is online. Go to **Data** > **Gateways** on the navigation pane, select the gateway name, click on **...** go to **Details** and verify if the **gateway status** is **online**.If the **gateway status** is **offline**, confirm that the device is turned on and connected to the Internet. 

1. Test your flow by sending an email to trigger it. You will see your desktop flow playing back the steps you recorded. 

   ![Successful run that calls a desktop flow.](../media/run-desktop-flow/successful-run.png "Successful run that calls a desktop flow")

   >[!TIP]
   >Do not interact with your device while the flow runs.

## Use inputs and outputs

When you define inputs and outputs within a desktop flow, you can pass information from and to those inputs.

1. When you add a desktop flow to a cloud flow, you can see the list of inputs that were defined in the Windows recorder (V1) flow.

   ![Desktop flow inputs.](../media/run-desktop-flow/inputs.png "Desktop flow inputs")

1. You can populate each input field in the desktop flow with values from previous steps in the flow. To do this, select the input field, and then select an input from the token picker.


1. You can also use outputs from your desktop flow as inputs for actions that appear later in the flow. To do this, select the input field, and then select an input from the token picker.


## Use sensitive text inputs

Some inputs like passwords need to be obfuscated and omitted from logging while being used in the application. Desktop flows supports inputs called **Sensitive text inputs** for storing these "private" values. 

For more information on how to create these types of inputs, click here.


To retrieve sensitive content from another connector, turn on **Secure Inputs** and **Secure Outputs** by following these steps:
1.	Select **…** on the top right corner of the action.
1.	Select **Settings**.

    ![The settings option](../media/run-desktop-flow/settings.png "The settings option")

1. Turn on the **Secure Inputs** and **Secure Outputs** properties to prevent these settings from being shown in the logs.

   ![Secure inputs and outputs.](../media/run-desktop-flow/secure-outputs-secure-inputs.png "Secure inputs and outputs")

1.	Select **Done**.
   
    You will notice that the action now has a lock icon on the top right, indicating special handling for input and output values.

      ![The lock icon.](../media/run-desktop-flow/lock-icon.png "The lock icon")

   
      >[!TIP]
      >Follow the same steps to configure inputs as given earlier in this article to pass the output from this connector to a desktop flow, and then turn on **Secure Text** in the **Settings**.

      ![Pass outputs to desktop flow .](../media/run-desktop-flow/pass-to-desktop-flow.png "Desktop flow inputs")


## Run desktop flows unattended or attended

When you create desktop flows, you run them either in **attended** or **unattended** mode. Unattended is best for applications that do not need human supervision.

When running unattended, desktop flows automatically signs into the target devices that run Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019. Once the automation completes, desktop flows signs out from the device and reports its activity in Power Automate.

When running attended, desktop flows will use an existing Windows user session.

When you add a desktop flow to a cloud flow, you can choose whether you want your desktop flow to run attended or unattended. Here are some key differences between attended and unattended runs:

### Unattended mode

To run unattended desktop flows, the target machine needs to be available with all users signed out. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Locked Windows user sessions will prevent desktop flows from running.

Desktop flows perform the following:
1. Desktop flow creates, manages, and then releases the Windows user session on the target devices.

1. Unattended Desktop flows run on devices with the screen locked so that no one can see the flow while it runs.

1. Windows 10 devices cannot run unattended if there are any active Windows user sessions present (even a locked one). You will receive this error: *Cannot execute Desktop flow. There is a locked or an inactive Windows user session on the target device*.

1. On Windows Server, if you have a locked Windows user session open with the same user as the desktop flow is supposed to run as, you will receive the same error: *Cannot execute Desktop flow. There is a locked or inactive Windows user session on the target device*.

### Attended mode
To run an attended desktop flow, you need to have an active Windows user session that matches the name of the user configured for your connection. The session must not be locked.

When an attended desktop flow starts on the target machine, we recommend that you avoid interacting with your device until the run completes.


## Run multiple desktop flows on the same device sequentially 

You can schedule multiple desktop flows to run on one or more devices. If more than one desktop flow is triggered to run on the same device, Power Automate follows these rules:

1.  The first desktop flow runs on the target device.

1.  Queues other desktop flows and then displays them as **Waiting** in the desktop flows and gateway details page.

1.  Picks the next **Waiting** desktop flow when each run completes.

>[!NOTE]
>These orchestration rules apply to desktop flows runs that are scheduled by any user on the same device.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If there are too many desktop flows in the execution queue a timeout might occur. 
>Desktop flows runs will fail if they don’t run within 30 minutes after being triggered.

## Run desktop flows concurrently on Windows Server devices
Multiple users can be signed in simultaneously on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. Power Automate leverages this OS capability to simultaneously run multiple desktop flows on such devices. With this feature, your organization can save on its infrastructure costs.

Perform the following steps to benefit from multiple desktop flows on a single device:
1. Setup a Windows Server 2016 or 2019 device with the on-premises gateway and the latest version of desktop flows installed.
1. Use two or more user accounts to create desktop flows connections targeting the gateway on this device. 

Power Automate automatically scales the number of concurrent desktop flows runs to the maximum supported by the device. If the capacity of the device is exceeded, the additional runs  *wait* as [described here](./run-pad-flow.md#run-multiple-desktop-flows-on-the-same-device-sequentially).

>[!IMPORTANT]
If you want to use more than two parallel user sessions on Windows Server, you must turn on Remote Desktop Services. Learn more about [RDS](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-client-access-license).

>[!NOTE]
>Running multiple concurrent desktop flows by the **same user** is not supported. You will need to have different users running desktop flows at the same time to benefit from this feature.

## Load balance requests across gateways in a cluster

You can choose to distribute desktop flow runs evenly across gateways in a cluster. By default, the selection of a gateway during load balancing is random.

Follow [these steps to add a gateway to create a cluster](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install#add-another-gateway-to-create-a-cluster)

>[!NOTE]
>Offline gateway members within a cluster will negatively impact performance. Disable or remove these members.

To provide load balancing from the Power Automate gateway details page, navigate to **Data** -> **Gateways**, and then select your gateway cluster. 

In the gateway details page, toggle Run on all gateways in cluster. This will distribute the desktop flows runs on all the gateways within that cluster.

   ![Distribute desktop flow run on gateway cluster.](../media/run-desktop-flow/gw_cluster.png "Distribute desktop flow run on gateway cluster")
   
>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you are using local Windows accounts, all machines in the cluster must have the same local account with the same password. Use these credentials when you create the desktop flow connection.
>If you are using Active Directory or Azure AD joined machines, confirm that the user account you will be use in the desktop flow connection can access all machines in the cluster.
   
## Best practices to avoid timeouts and distribute load across machines

If you plan to run multiple desktop flows, there are a set of strategies you can adopt to distribute load and ensure that all your desktop flows run successfully without overloading the target machine(s) or running into timeouts because multiple desktop flows are running at the same time. You can either:

1. Plan your desktop flows to run at different times of the day, spreading your load over time. This works best if you have a single or a limited set of machines that can run workloads, and you can control the triggers (for example, scheduled flows) that start your desktop flows.
1. Create clusters of machines that can run desktop flows with identical configurations in parallel. 
1. Create multiple flows that each use a separate connection to target different machines.

By following these strategies, you can avoid having desktop flows competing to run on the same device and in some cases failing due to timeouts. 

>[!NOTE]
>If you are running desktop flows in unattended mode, you will need to anticipate the number of desktop flows your organization plans to run in parallel, and then purchase an adequate amount of Unattended Add-ons. 


## Rerun failed desktop flows

If a desktop flow run fails, correct the issue, and then try the following steps to rerun it: 

   1. Go to the details page and identify the failed run.

   1. Select the **Resubmit** button from the action menu.

## Support long running desktop flows
Some of your desktop flows might run for long durations (e.g. more than 24 hours). To ensure that those flows run successfully and don't fail due to the default timeout values:

1.	Select **…** on the top right corner of the  desktop flows action.
1.	Select **Settings**.

    ![The settings option .](media/run-pad-portal/timeout_settings.png "The settings option")

1.  Select the **Timeout** property and update the duration to correctly handle your dekstop flow run. 
1.	Select **Done**.

## Troubleshoot failures

1. If your unattended desktop flow fails with the **cannot create new session** message, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

    - On Windows 10, confirm that you don’t have an active user session locked or unlocked on your target device.
    - On Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019, confirm you haven’t reached the maximum number of active user sessions that's configured for your device. Desktop flows won’t be able to run if it cannot create new sessions.

1. If you are running desktop flows on a non-English language operating system and you receive a *502 - Bad request* message, confirm you have followed the [steps to upgrade your desktop flows from preview](upgrade.md).


1. If the **gateway status** is **offline**, confirm that the device is turned on and connected to the Internet. You may also [troubleshoot the gateway](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-tshoot).

1. If the **gateway status** is **online**, try the following actions:

   - Confirm the desktop flows app and services are running on your device.

   - Restart the desktop flow service on your device.
