# Use RPA with Dynamics 365 Customer Service

Automate common activities on Dynamics 365 Customer Service with Robotic Process Automation using Power Automate.

[Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) empowers your organization to deliver operational excellence, bringing delight to every customer. To make your use of Dynamics 365 even more productive, we are releasing the preview of free automation solutions that Dynamics 365 customers can use to automate common tasks.

This article outlines the steps needed for you to automate customer validation in [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-service/overview/) and focus on higher-priority activities that require your unique creativity.

## Prerequisites

Here's what you need to prepare your environment.

### Software

Install the following:

- Dynamics 365 for Customer Service.

- Power Automate for desktop. Power Automate for desktop will carry out the steps in Dynamics 365 as if a human were doing it in front of their computer.

- The Contoso CRM app from Microsoft. This app showcases how RPA works. You can use it as an example to build your own RPA action.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure to [get the appropriate security roles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2127645) for the account that runs your automation. This account can be a dedicated one that your admin in Azure Active Directory creates or an employee's account.

Use these recommended security roles.

| **Application**                              | **Security role**                                                                                                                | **Link to documentation**                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Power Platform                               | Option 1: Environment admin <br>Option 2: Environment maker (if the environment already has Dataverse and unattended license needed) |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dynamics 365 for Customer Service | D365 Customer Service administrator                                                                                              | [Enable users for Customer Service and assign roles](/dynamics365/customer-service/add-users-assign-roles) |

### Licenses

1. Get a trial license for Power Automate if you don't have a paid license.The Power Automate license you need depends on the mode in which your automations run. 

   Here are the two modes to automate processes.

   - **Attended mode**: someone is sits at computer and watches the process run as if they were doing it themselves manually. For attended mode, users must have **the Power Automate per-user license with RPA**.

   - **Unattended mode**: the process is runs in the background without any human interaction and it's not visible on the device. For attended mode, users must have two licenses.

      - **The Power Automate per-user license with RPA**
      - **The Power Automate unattended add-on**.


   Follow these steps to get a *Power Automate per-user license with RPA* to run processes in attended mode.

   1. From Power Automate, select **My Flows** > **Desktop flows**.

   1. Select **Start free trial now**.


   To add a trial license for *Power Automate unattended add-on** to run processes in unattended mode, you must ask a tenant admin to get an *RPA unattended add-on* and assign it to your environment [Power Automate sign-up Q&A in your organization](../organization-q-and-a.md).

1. Get a trial license for the Dynamics 365 Customer Service app.

1. To get started with [Dynamics 365 for Customer Service](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/get-started/free-trial/?appname=customerservice) and automate the customer validation process.

## Set up your device

   ![Screenshot of the Run Automation to validate Customer button. ](./media/dynamics365-cs-rpa/run-validation.png)

1. The automation starts on the machine where you have installed Power Automate. You can watch how the automation uses the case data, opens the Contoso CRM app, and then finishes the look up automatically. After the automation runs, refresh the timeline to view the logs regarding the run result. Here's a demo on how it runs.

   ![Screenshot of a demo showing the automation.](./media/dynamics365-cs-rpa/bf728be4c965a04f9d199266accb06bd.gif)

## Customize the automation solution

1. Now you can start customizing the automation to meet your unique requirements. To do this, open Power Automate and then select **Edit** on the **Legacy Contoso App Contact Lookup** desktop flow.

   ![Screenshot of the edit button in the Power Automate for desktop console.](./media/dynamics365-cs-rpa/a93f6fd5dd7cf00398816add4711c557.png)

1. You can save a copy to work on your customizations or work on the template directly.

1. Notice that there are multiple child flows. Each child flow uses the keyboard or the mouse to interact with the Contoso CRM app. You need to update the steps to interact with your legacy app.

1. After you test the desktop flow, you can save it. Now open the cloud flow in <https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/manage/solutions> from within the solution tab -\> Customer Service RPA solution

    ![Screenshot of the Solution tab in the Power Automate portal.](./media/dynamics365-cs-rpa/4f66650ddfd5e345f0de2499c1f14ede.png)

1. Open the cloud flow named “Automation to validate customer info”. Expand each action to review. In the Desktop flow action, you can switch to use any desktop flow you want and use any the input/output parameter that you want to use. To learn more, read [here](link-pad-flow-portal.md) on how to use desktop flow in cloud flow.

1. Now you can save the cloud flow. Go back to D365 portal and trigger the agent script action to test. You will see your customization  automation start to run.

1. Once you finished testing, you can share the cloud flow with everyone in the organization with run-only mode (click [here](run-pad-flow.md#unattended-mode) to learn more) and switch it to run unattended way (click [here](run-pad-flow.md#unattended-mode) to learn more). So that every agent will be able to reuse the same automation. License wise, the cloud flow should be put under a per flow plan (click [here](/power-platform-release-plan/2019wave2/power-automate/new-licensing-options-power-automate-standalone-paid-plans#allocating-the-per-flow-plan-in-the-admin-center) to learn more)
