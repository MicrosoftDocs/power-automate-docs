# Power Automate for desktop prerequisites & limitations

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft work or school account to sign into Power Automate


- System requirements:

   - A device that runs Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 11 Home, Windows 11 Pro, Windows 11 Enterprise, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. ARM devices are not supported.
      
      - Minimum hardware
        - Processor: 1.00GHz or faster with 2 or more cores 
        - Storage: 1GB
	     - RAM: 2GB

      - Recommended hardware
        - Processor: 1.60GHz or faster with 2 or more cores  
        - Storage: 2GB
	     - RAM: 4GB
	     - GPU acceleration
     - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later 

> [!NOTE]
> - The system requirements do not include the resources required for the applications involved in the flows.
> - To install Power Automate, an account with administrator privileges to sign in to your Windows device is required.
     
> [!TIP]
> If your device runs Windows 10 Home, you can use Power Automate to create your desktop flows and monitor them on [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com). You can't trigger desktop flows to run from the cloud on Windows 10 Home devices. Other types of desktop flows (Windows recorder V1 and Selenium IDE) are not supported.

## Run Power Automate with elevated rights

While creating desktop flows, some actions may need to access resources with elevated rights, such as files and applications. To run these actions successfully, launch Power Automate as administrator:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - To run desktop flows through the flow designer or the console to interact with an application running with elevated rights, launch Power Automate as an administrator. 
> - When a desktop flow is triggered by a cloud flow, the actions contained in the desktop flow that require elevated privileges won't have any effect. Therefore, Power Automate won't be able to access applications that run with elevated rights and their elements.

1. Before launching Power Automate, ensure that the application is closed and doesn't appear on the Windows system tray.

1. Right-click on the Power Automate icon and select **Run as administrator**. 

1. To confirm that Power Automate is launched with administrator rights, open the Windows Task Manager, navigate to the **Details** tab, and check that Power Automate runs with elevated privileges.

## Known issues and limitations

1. Only work or school account users with Dataverse database provisioned in their default environment can create Power Automate desktop flows. Power Automate desktop flows will be stored in the default environment with the Dataverse database. 

    If the Dataverse database doesn't exist in the default environment, the user will not be able to create desktop flows and be prompted to create a database. There will be no connectivity of Power Automate desktop flows with cloud flows.â€¯ 

    - After creating the Dataverse in the Power platform admin center, intermittently user might get prompted to create the database again. In this scenario, restart Power Automate for desktop (exit from the system tray icon).

 

1. If users have signed in with trial or paid accounts and want to connect their free Microsoft accounts, they have to use Power Automate for desktop version 2.6.48.21069 or above. Otherwise, they'll encounter the following error.  

      ![Screenshot of the prompted sign-in dialog with the respective error.](media\known-issues\pad-sign-in.png)


1. Power Automate applies the proxy configuration specified in Windows proxy settings. If the proxy server requires authentication, the administrator has to exclude Power Automate from using it or use another server that doesn't require authentication. You can find more information regarding bypassing proxy servers in [Configure Power Automate to bypass a corporate proxy server](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-to-bypass-a-corporate-proxy-server).

1. The number of actions that can be logged in a single desktop flow run is limited to 10 000. Additional actions will be performed but won't be logged.
