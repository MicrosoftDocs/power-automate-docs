# Run desktop flows via URL or desktop shortcuts

Power Automate, apart from triggering flows through the console, flow designer, and cloud flows, enables you to run desktop flows using run URLs and desktop shortcuts.

You can use URLs to trigger desktop flows through many different sources, such as browsers, the Windows Run application, the [command prompt](#use-a-run-url-in-the-command-prompt), and the [Windows Task Scheduler](#trigger-flows-automatically-with-task-scheduler). Alternatively, you can [create desktop shortcuts](#create-a-desktop-shortcut) and run your desktop flows directly through them.

If a triggered flow requires input variables, the console will ask you to enter the appropriate values.

By default, Power Automate always prompts you to confirm the triggering of a desktop flow via URL or desktop shortcut. To disable this functionality, navigate to the console settings and disable **Display confirmation dialog when invoking flows externally** or modify the [appropriate Windows registry entry](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-confirmation-dialog-when-invoking-flows-using-a-url-or-desktop-shortcut).

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling the confirmation dialog poses security threats because you could run without notice a questionable flow shared by a malicious actor.

## Prerequisites

- Power Automate for desktop needs to be installed on the machine.
- The user must be signed in.
- The user needs a trial or paid organization subscription or a pay-as-you-go environment.

## Create a desktop shortcut

To create a shortcut for a desktop flow, right-click its name in the console and select **Create desktop shortcut**. All shortcuts are automatically created in your desktop folder, but you can move them to any folder of your machine.

## Create a run URL

> [!Important]
> If a flow is already running, it won't run again when the URL is invoked.

To generate a URL that triggers a desktop flow, use one of the following formats:

```
"ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?workflowName=[workflowName]"
```

```
"ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?workflowId=[workflowId]"
```

```
"ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?environmentId=[environmentId]&workflowId=[workflowId]"
```

```
"ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?environmentId=[environmentId]&workflowName=[workflowIName]"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can find an automatically created run URL consisting of the environment and flow IDs on the details page of the desktop flow. You can find more information about flow details in [Desktop flow details](console.md#desktop-flow-details).

The first two formats don't define a specific environment, so Power Automate automatically uses the currently selected console environment. The command will be neglected if either flow ID or flow name isnâ€™t specified.

If the console is set to another environment than the one specified in the URL, the console environment will automatically change.

### Find environment and desktop flow IDs

To find the ID of an environment, navigate to the [Power Automate portal](https://make.powerautomate.com) and select the desired environment. Then, navigate to the **My flows** tab and copy the environment ID from the address line.

To find the ID of a desktop flow, launch the Power Automate console, select or right-click the appropriate flow, and select **Details**.

## Save logs for desktop flows run via URL

Apart from the mandatory input parameters, you can add the **runId** parameter to a run URL to define a unique GUID for the desktop flow logs.

Power Automate uses this GUID to create a folder and store the logs inside it. The logs are stored in: **C:\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Console\Scripts\\[Flow ID]\Runs\\[Run ID]**

> [!NOTE]
> A GUID is a 128-bit value consisting of one group of 8 hexadecimal digits, three groups of 4 digits each, and one group of 12 digits, for example: **e6f82a20-47f7-4dd8-a97f-63df36797d0f**.

A URL containing the **runId** input parameter should have the following structure. The parameter can be added to any of the previously mentioned URLs.

```
"ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?workflowId=[workflowId]&runId=[GUID]"
```

## Use a run URL in the command prompt

To trigger a flow using the command prompt, use a command with the following syntax:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Power Automate Desktop\PAD.Console.Host.exe" "ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?workflowName=[workflowName]"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can replace the second part of the command with any of the previously presented URL formats.

## Trigger flows automatically with Task Scheduler

To trigger a flow using the Task Scheduler application of Windows:

1. Create a new task, navigate to the **Actions** tab of the **Create Task** dialog, and add a new action.

1. Populate the following value in the **Program/script** field.

    ```
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Power Automate Desktop\PAD.Console.Host.exe
    ```

1. Populate the following value in the **Add arguments** field.

    ```
    ms-powerautomate:/console/flow/run?workflowName=[workflowName]
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    > You can replace the given argument with any of the previously presented URL formats.
