# Compare your desktop flow changes

When you commit a change to your repository by running your export pipeline, you can see the differences between two versions of your solutions by going to Azure DevOps.

## Compare the desktop flow definition

The desktop flow definition is stored in the **Workflow** folder in a file with the extension `.json.data.xml`. From [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/), you can open the file on the **History** tab to observe the difference.

## New image or control added to the desktop flow

When a new image or a control is added to your desktop flow, they're added as a new folder in the **desktopflowbinaries** folder. Each image has a dedicated folder, with a subfolder, which contains the screenshot. The file is named **Untitled.txt**.
