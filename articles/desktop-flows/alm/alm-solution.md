# Add a cloud flow, desktop flow and connection reference to a solution

If you've followed the article [for configuring ALM for desktop flows](alm-intro.md), at this point you've created a solution. Now, add a desktop flow and a cloud flow to this solution. If you haven't created a solution yet, [create a publisher and a solution](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm#solution-lifecycle)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order for a cloud flow to be added to a solution, the cloud flow has to be created in the solution. You can't add a cloud flow to a solution after it's been created.

## Create a desktop flow

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), and then go to **Solutions**, and then open the unmanaged solution you want or select **New solution** to [create a solution](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-solution).
1. Select **New** > **Automation** > **Desktop flow**.

You're redirected to Power Automate desktop, once you have finished editing your desktop flow, go back to the solution page to see your desktop flow appear.

## Create a cloud flow

From within the solution, select **New** > **Automation** > **Cloud flow** > **Scheduled**.

You're redirected to the cloud flow designer. Edit to add an action with a desktop flow, and if needed, create a connection. You need to use the **Unattended** run mode.

The connection you use won't be the connection that is used in your production environment.

You see the cloud flow in your solution and a connection reference.
