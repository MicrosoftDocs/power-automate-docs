# Install Power Automate

Before you install Power Automate on your device, make sure that it meets the [system requirements](requirements.md).

Download and install Power Automate [using an MSI installer](#install-power-automate-using-the-msi-installer) or [from Microsoft Store](#install-power-automate-from-microsoft-store). The Microsoft Store installation doesn't require you to have admin rights on your device and is updated automatically regularly. The MSI installer requires admin rights and requires manual updates. However it also includes an option to install the machine runtime application, which allows you to [manage machines from the Power Automate portal](manage-machines.md). You can use the Power Automate for desktop store installation in conjunction with the runtime application, which you can install from the MSI.

> [!NOTE]
> Having both versions of Power Automate on your machine isn't supported. You must choose between Power Automate MSI installer or Microsoft Store (MSIX).

By default, Power Automate for desktop honors the proxy settings specified in Windows. To learn how to override this configuration for the Power Automate console, go to [Power Automate for desktop using a proxy server](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-to-interact-with-a-corporate-proxy-server). To learn how to configure proxy settings for the machine runtime, go to [override them after install](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/power-automate-for-desktop-proxy-setup-8a79d690-1c02-416f-8af1-f057df5fe9b7).

## Install Power Automate using the MSI installer

> [!NOTE]
> Admin permissions on your local computer are required to install Power Automate for desktop using the MSI installer.

1. [Download the Power Automate installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2102613). Save the file to your desktop or Downloads folder.

1. Run the **Setup.Microsoft.PowerAutomate.exe** file.

1. Follow the instructions in the **Power Automate for desktop setup** installer.

1. Make your selections for each feature:

    - **Power Automate for desktop** is the app you use to build, edit, and run desktop flows.

    - **Machine-runtime app** allows you to connect your machine to the Power Automate cloud and harness the full power of robotic process automation (RPA). [Learn more about machine management](./manage-machines.md).

    - Install required files for UI automation in Java applets. Close all Java-related processes before you install these files.

1. Select the check box to agree to the terms of use, and then select **Install**.

If the installation fails, go to the [troubleshooting guide](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/power-automate-desktop-installation-troubleshooting-b2c93d3f-5a90-450a-833d-920a25f2d967) for help.
