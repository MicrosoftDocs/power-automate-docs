# Create orders on Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management 

[Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) empowers your organization to deliver operational excellence and delight every customer. In order to make your use of Dynamics 365 even more productive and save users time and errors, we are releasing the preview for free automation solutions that will let customers of Dynamics 365 customers automate common tasks.  

In this documentation, we outline the steps needed for administrators to allow users to automate quality order creation for Dynamics 365 [Supply Chain Management](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/supply-chain-management/overview/) and focus on higher-priority activities that require their unique creativity.  

## Prerequisites 

Before starting, we need to prepare your environment with the adequate licenses and software set-up. This section provides a step-by-step for how to get the grounds ready.   

### Software 

You will need to: 
- install the Power Automate for desktop application. Power Automate will carry out the steps in Dynamics 365 as if a human were doing it in front of their computer.  
- Log out of the Dynamics 365 app you wish to automate 
- Get the appropriate security role for the automation to run 

### Log out of the Dynamics 365 app you wish to automate 

In order to do the full automation, please sign out of the application before you run the automation for the first time. You will need to do this if you switch between automation and your account.  

### Get the appropriate security role set up for the account running the automation 

You will need to decide which work account will be running the automation. It can be a dedicated account created by your admin in Azure Active Directory or the account of an existing employee. For the account you end up choosing, you need to check that it has the appropriate security roles so that it can access the surfaces you are automating.  

We recommend the following security roles: 

|Application|Security role|Link to documentation|
|----|----|----|
|Power Platform|Environment admin or environment maker (if the environment already has Dataverse and unattended license needed)||
|Dynamic 365 Supply Chain Management||

### Licenses 

If you already use Power Automate, PowerApps and Dynamics 365 applications on a day-to-day basis, you can skip this section and jump to Installing the Dynamics 365 RPA solutions.  

Otherwise, you will need at least a trial license for these 3 products. This section shows you how to acquire these trial licenses.  

#### Get a trial license for Power Automate  
Power Automate can automate processes by doing what a human would do on a keyboard and screen.  

There are two ways to automate processes: 
1. Attended mode: someone is sitting in front of their computer and watching the process run as if they were doing it themselves manually 
1. Unattended mode: the process is running in the background on distant machines that users don’t see.  

To run attended, users need to acquire **the Power Automate per-user license with RPA**.  
To run unattended, users need to have acquire two licenses: **Power Automate per-user license with RPA and the Power Automate unattended add-on**. 

*Get a trial license for Power Automate per-user license with RPA to run processes in attended mode*

1. From the Power Automate portal, navigate to My Flows then on Desktop Flows 
1. Click the fine print **Start free trial now**

An alternative consists in logging in to Power Automate for desktop and clicking on the **Start free trial** button 

*Add a trial license for Power Automate unattended add-on to run processes in unattended mode*

As an admin, you can get an RPA unattended add-on and assign it to your environment [Power Automate sign-up Q&A in your organization - Power Automate | Microsoft Docs](../organization-q-and-a.md)  

#### Get a trial license for Power Apps 

Please follow the instructions in this PowerApps guide before moving on to the last step! [/en-us/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps#get-a-license-from-scratch](/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps)
