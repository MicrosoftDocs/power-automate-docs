# Safe stop

The safe stop feature in Power Automate for desktop enables users to halt the execution of a desktop flow in a controlled and secure manner. Unlike abrupt terminations, safe stop ensures that the flow completes its current action and executes a predefined set of cleanup steps before stopping. This helps maintain data integrity and avoids leaving systems in an inconsistent state.

## How safe stop works

To use safe stop, two components must be configured:

- Safe stop trigger:
  - Safe stop can be initiated in two ways:
    - From the Power Automate portal: Navigate to the **Run Details** page of a running desktop flow and select **Safe Stop**. :::image type="content" source="media/safe-stop/safe-stop-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of button to safe stop a desktop flow execution through the Power Automate portal.":::
    - From the Power Automate for desktop designer: Use the dropdown on the **Stop** button and then select **Safe stop**. 
      - This option is especially useful during debugging or when a flow needs to be halted gracefully in the designer without disrupting the environment. :::image type="content" source="media/safe-stop/safe-stop-designer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of button to safe stop a desktop flow execution through the Power Automate for desktop designer.":::
- Safe stop in the flow:
  - Within the desktop flow, insert the **If safe stop is requested** action (found under the **Flow Control** module). This action checks whether a safe stop has been requested. If so, it executes the block of actions defined within it.
    - The action includes a **Stop the flow** parameter:
      - If set to true, the flow stops automatically after the block is executed.
      - If set to false, the user must explicitly insert a **Stop Flow** action to terminate execution.
  - This allows flexibility in defining what should happen when a safe stop is triggered—such as saving files, closing connections, or logging status—before the flow ends.

## Best practices

- Place the **If safe stop is requested** action at logical checkpoints in your flow where cleanup or rollback might be necessary.
- Use the **Stop the flow** parameter thoughtfully to control whether the flow should end immediately or continue after handling the stop request.
- Consider using safe stop during development and testing to safely interrupt flows without losing context or corrupting data.

## Limitations

- Safe Stop must be triggered before the **If safe stop is requested** action is reached in the flow. If the action is bypassed or not yet executed, the stop request doesn't take effect until the next checkpoint.
- This feature isn't a pause or resume mechanism. Once triggered and executed, the flow stops as defined.
