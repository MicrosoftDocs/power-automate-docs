# Hosted machines

Hosted machines allow you to build, test, and run attended and unattended desktop flows without providing or setting up any physical machines.

You can create hosted machines directly through the Power Automate portal. Power Automate automatically provisions a Windows machine based on your configuration and registers it to your environment. Access your hosted machines in the Power Automate portal and start building your desktop flows within minutes. Hosted machines use [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) for provisioning and access.

Here are some of the highlights of what you can do with hosted machines:

- Build and test desktop flows using Power Automate for desktop.
- Run attended and unattended desktop flows.
- Assign your hosted machines to [machine groups](hosted-machine-groups.md) to distribute your automation workload.

Key capabilities:

- **Work or school account integration**: Enables access to resources that are part of the business plan linked to your organization, such as Office, SharePoint, and Azure.

- **Vanilla or custom VM images for your hosted machine**: Use a vanilla VM image provided by Microsoft or personalize your hosted machines by providing your own Windows image directly from your Azure Compute Gallery. Providing your own Windows image allows you to have all your applications installed on the provisioned hosted machines.

- **Connect to your own virtual network**: Securely communicate with each other, the Internet, and your on-premises networks.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sign-in access is only available to the creator of the hosted machine.


## Licensing requirements

To use hosted machines, you need the following licensing option:

- Use your existing **Power Automate Premium plan** (previously Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA) and the **Power Automate hosted RPA add-on**.

   Assign to your environment as many add-ons as the number of hosted machines you want to run in your environment.

You'll also need the following prerequisite licenses: Windows, Intune, Microsoft Entra ID.


### Trial licenses for evaluation

To evaluate hosted machines, you need one of the following trial licensing options:

- Use the **Power Automate Premium** plan (previously Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA) and the **Power Automate hosted RPA add-on trials**.

    The Power Automate hosted RPA add-on have trial versions that last 30 days and can be extended once to a total of 60 day. Organization admins can obtain up to 25 seats from [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home), assign those Power Automate Premium (previously Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA) trials to 25 individual makers, and assign the hosted RPA add-ons to the targeted environment.

- Use the **90-days self-assisted premium trial.**

    Trial users are granted the capacity of one hosted machine per tenant. To start a trial, select **Try free** under **Power Automate Premium** in the [Power Automate pricing page](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/pricing/) or the desktop flow page of the [Power Automate portal](https://make.powerautomate.com/).

## Prerequisites

This section presents all the prerequisites to create and use hosted machines.

### Microsoft Entra and Intune requirements

- A valid and working Intune and Microsoft Entra tenant.
- Ensure that Intune device type enrollment restrictions are set to **Allow Windows (MDM) platform for corporate enrollment**.

To find more information about the Microsoft Entra and Intune requirements, go to [Windows 365 requirements](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements?tabs=enterprise%2Cent#azure-active-directory-and-intune-requirements).

### Windows 365 Cloud PC and Azure Virtual Desktop service principal

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop service principals should automatically be created in your tenant. You can skip this step, unless you face an error  with service principals not created in your tenant when you provision the hosted machine.
    
1. Validate if the Windows 365 service principal is already created:

    1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra** > **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

    1. Remove filter **Application type == Enterprise Applications**.

    1. Fill filter **Application ID starts with** with the Windows 365 application ID **0af06dc6-e4b5-4f28-818e-e78e62d137a5**.

        If the service principal is provisioned in your Microsoft Entra, the page should look like the following screenshot:

        :::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enterprise applications in Microsoft Entra ID.":::

        If the application is like the presented screenshot, you don't need to perform any extra steps. However, you must create the service principal if the application isn't showing up.

1. Create the Windows 365 service principal.

    You can create an Azure service principal with the [az ad sp create](/cli/azure/ad/sp) command from the [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/).

    ```Azure-CLI-command
    az ad sp create --id 0af06dc6-e4b5-4f28-818e-e78e62d137a5
    ```

1. Create other service principals related to Azure Virtual Desktop.

    To create a hosted machine, you must create the following Azure Virtual Desktop services in your tenant.


    | Application name                   | Application ID                       |
    |------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | Azure Virtual Desktop              | 9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07 |
    | Azure Virtual Desktop Client       | a85cf173-4192-42f8-81fa-777a763e6e2c |
    | Azure Virtual Desktop ARM Provider | 50e95039-b200-4007-bc97-8d5790743a63 |

    Follow the same instruction as for creating the Windows 365 application to check and create the service principals.

### Get access to the default VM image

To create hosted machines, you need access to the default image that is part of your environment. You can view the default image in **Monitors** > **Machines** > **VM images**.

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/default-vm-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the default VM image in the VM images list.":::

Users need either the **System Administrator** or **Desktop Flow Machine Image Admin** role to see and manage the default image. For other users, the **System Administrator** or **Desktop Flow Machine Image Admin** needs to [share the default image](#share-the-default-image) with them before they can use it.

### Share the default image

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. Go to **Monitor** > **Machines** > **VM images**.

1. Select the default Windows desktop image from the list.

1. Select **Manage access**.

1. Select **Add people** and enter the name of the person in your organization with whom youâ€™d like to share the image.

1. Select the names of the persons and choose which permissions they can access the machine with.

1. Select **Save**.

## Use a custom virtual network for your hosted machines

You can connect to your own virtual network with your hosted machines to securely communicate with each other, the Internet, and on-premises networks. Providing your own virtual network from your Azure subscription allows your hosted machines to be provisioned with your virtual network automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> You can have up to 30 custom virtual networks configured per tenant.

### General network requirement

To use your own network and provision Microsoft Entra joined hosted machines, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a virtual network in your Azure subscription in the same region where you've created the hosted machines.
- Follow [Azureâ€™s Network guidelines](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/network-guidance).
- A subnet within the virtual network and available IP address space.

The virtual network needs to be created in the same location with your hosted machines. You can find the following mapping with your environment Geo:

- Australia: Australia East
- Asia: East Asia
- Brazil: Brazil South
- Canada: Canada Central
- Europe: North Europe
- France: France Central

1. For each user, you can grant different permissions: **User** or **Co-owner**.

    **User** permission only allows the targeted user to run desktop flows on the selected hosted machine. A **Co-Owner** can also edit the hosted machine details.

> [!NOTE]
> - Sign-in access is only available to the creator of the hosted machine.
> - When a user isn't part of an environment anymore, you may continue to see the user as deactivated. You'll be notified in the **Manage access** section of the hosted machine if it's shared with deactivated users. In this situation, remove access to them.

## Run desktop flows on hosted machines

Power Automate enables you to trigger desktop flows on your hosted machines as you do on standard machines. To implement this functionality, you need a [desktop flow connection](desktop-flow-connections.md) to your hosted machine.

To find more information about triggering desktop flows from cloud flows, go to [Trigger desktop flows from cloud flows](link-pad-flow-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you intend to run unattended desktop flows on your hosted machine using the default virtula machine (VM) image option, you'll need to [disable Network Level Authentication](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/ui-flows-run-failed-with-aadlogonfailure-error) on your machine.


## Restart hosted machines

Power Automate enables you to restart your hosted machines from the Power Automate portal. To restart your hosted machine:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

1. Go to **Monitor** > **Machines**.

1. Select the **Machines** tab.

1. Select a hosted machine in the list and navigate to the details page of it.

1. Select **Restart machine**.

> [!NOTE]
> The hosted machine is restart may take a few minutes to complete. Please wait for a few minutes before trying to [access the hosted machine](#access-a-hosted-machine).

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/restart-hosted-machine.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the restart hosted machine capability.":::


## Permissions based on security roles

Hosted machine permissions and roles are iterations on top of [Desktop Flows Machine Management permissions and roles](manage-machines.md#update-permissions-based-on-security-role). A hosted machine group follows the same rules and privileges as a regular group.

### Creation of hosted machine and privileges

This section describes the permissions for hosted machines.

#### Environment Maker role

By default, the **Environment Maker** role can create hosted machines in their environment. The entities that require privileges to use hosted machines are:

- Flow Machine
- Flow Machine Group
- Flow Machine Image
- Flow Machine Network (if using custom virtual network for your hosted machine)

The Environment Maker role can [create and share custom VM images](#use-custom-vm-images-for-your-hosted-machine), as these actions require create and append privileges on the **Flow Machine Image**.

The Environment Maker role can [create and share custom virtual network](#use-a-custom-virtual-network-for-your-hosted-machines), as these actions require create and append privileges on the **Flow Machine Network**.

Admins can also use the roles provided as part of Desktop Flows. You can find more information about desktop flow security roles in [Manage Machines](manage-machines.md#update-permissions-based-on-security-role).

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/environment-maker-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Environment Maker role.":::

#### Desktop Flows Machine Owner role

By default, the **Desktop Flows Machine owner** can create hosted machines, but can't create custom VM images or custom virtual network. They can only use previously shared [custom VM images](#use-custom-vm-images-for-your-hosted-machine) or [custom virtual networks](#use-a-custom-virtual-network-for-your-hosted-machines) in their own hosted machine.

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/desktop-flows-machine-owner-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Desktop Flows Machine Owner role.":::

#### Desktop Flows Machine Configuration Admin role

The **Desktop Flows Machine Configuration Admin role** role only brings full privileges on the **Flow Machine Image** and **Flow Machine Network** entities. In particular, it allows users with this role to share/unshare VM images and virtual network to be used for created hosted machines in their environment. You can find more information about sharing pre-provisioned VM images and virtual network in [Create hosted machines](#create-a-hosted-machine).

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/desktop-flow-machine-configuration-admin-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Desktop Flows Machine Configuration Admin role.":::

## Hosted machines limitations

> [!NOTE]
> Hosted machines aren't yet available in sovereign clouds.


### Azure tenant country/region and supported geographies in the public cloud

A hosted machine stores limited metadata in the geography of your tenant's country, which can be different from the region of your Power Automate environment. By default, the cross-geo support for hosted machines is enabled. System admins and environment admins can disable or enable the feature from the Power Platform admin center.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

1. Go to **Environments**, and select the appropriate environment.

1. Select **Settings** > **Features**.

1. Under **Hosted RPA**, select the toggle for **Enable cross-geo support for hosted machines** to disable or enable this feature.

    :::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/enable-cross-geo-support-hosted machines.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enable cross-geo support for hosted machines option in the Power Platform admin center.":::

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling this feature at the environment level will restrict creation of hosted machines when your tenant's country or region on Azure don't fall within the same scope of the region for your Power Automate environment.
> To check the tenant country/region on Azure:
> 1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
> 1. Open the **Tenant properties** service. The **Country or region** is available as one of the properties.
>
>    :::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/tenant-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Country or region tenant property.":::

### Deletion of unused resources

For environments without the Power Automate hosted RPA add-on, we clean unused resources to ensure our service is available for everyone. A hosted machine that has been inactive for 14 days may be automatically deleted. The deleted hosted machine will still be visible but can't be used anymore. An inactive hosted machine is a machine that has no flow runs and no usage of Power Automate for desktop for the last 14 days.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to delete the inactive hosted machine and recreate a new one to continue using the hosted machines feature. You need to reconfigure the connections associated with your cloud flows.

## Troubleshoot hosted machines
