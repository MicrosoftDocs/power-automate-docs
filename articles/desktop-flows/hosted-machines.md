# Hosted machines (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Hosted machines allow you to build, test, and run attended and unattended desktop flows without providing or setting up any physical machines.

You can create hosted machines directly through the Power Automate portal. Power Automate will automatically provision a Windows machine based on your configuration and register it to your environment. Access your hosted machines in the Power Automate portal and start building your desktop flows within minutes. Hosted machines use [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/windows-365) for provisioning and access.

Here are some of the highlights of what you can do with hosted machines:

- Build and test desktop flows using Power Automate for desktop.
- Run attended and unattended desktop flows.
- Assign your hosted machines to [machine groups](hosted-machine-groups.md) to distribute your automation workload.

Key capabilities:

- **Work or school account integration:** Enables access to resources that are part of the business plan linked to your organization, such as Office, SharePoint, and Azure.

- **Vanilla or Custom VM images for your hosted machine:** Use a vanilla VM image provided by Microsoft or personalize your hosted machines by providing your own Windows image directly from your Azure Compute Gallery. Providing your own Windows image allows you to have all your applications installed on the provisioned hosted machines.

- **Connect to your own virtual network (vNET):** Securely communicate with each other, the Internet, and your on-premises networks.

## Licensing requirements

To use hosted machines, you need one of the following Power Automate licensing options:

- Use your existing **Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA** or **per flow plan** and the **Power Automate unattended RPA add-on** or the **Power Automate hosted RPA add-on**.

    During the preview period, hosted machines will be available for the existing licenses. Assign to your environment as many add-ons as the number of hosted machines you want to run in parallel in your environment.

- Use the **Power Automate per user plan with attended RPA trial** and the **Power Automate unattended RPA add-on trial**.

    The plans and add-ons mentioned above have trial versions that last 30 days and can be extended once to a total of 60 days. Organization admins can obtain up to 25 seats from [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home), assign those attended RPA trials to 25 individual makers, and assign the unattended RPA add-on to the targeted environments.
    
- Use the **90-days self-assisted premium trial.**

    Trial users are granted the capacity of one hosted machine. To start a trial, select **Try free** under **Per-user plan with attended RPA** in the [Power Automate pricing page](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/pricing/) or the desktop flow page of the [Power Automate portal](http://make.powerautomate.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> All tenants have a global limit of ten hosted machines.

You'll also need the following prerequisite licenses: Windows, Intune, Azure AD.

## Prerequisites

This section presents all the prerequisites to create and use hosted machines.

### Azure Active Directory and Intune requirements

- A valid and working Intune and Azure Active Directory tenant.
- Ensure that Intune device type enrollment restrictions are set to **Allow Windows (MDM) platform for corporate enrollment**.

To find more information about the Azure Active Directory and Intune requirements, go to [Windows 365 requirements](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements?tabs=enterprise%2Cent#azure-active-directory-and-intune-requirements).

### Windows 365 Cloud PC application

To create a hosted machine, you must create the Windows 365 service principal in your tenant.

1. Check if the Windows 365 service principal is already created:

    1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

    1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **Enterprise applications** > **All applications**.

    1. Remove filter **Application type == Enterprise Applications**.

    1. Fill filter **Application ID starts with** with the Windows 365 application ID **0af06dc6-e4b5-4f28-818e-e78e62d137a5**.

        If the service principal is provisioned in your Azure Active Directory, the page should look like the following screenshot:

        If the application is like the presented screenshot, you don't need to perform any extra steps. However, you must create the service principal if the application isn't showing up.

        :::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enterprise applications in Azure Active Directory.":::

1. Create the Windows 365 service principal.

    You can create an Azure service principal with the [az ad sp create](/cli/azure/ad/sp) command from the [Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/).

    ```Azure-CLI-command
    az ad sp create --id 0af06dc6-e4b5-4f28-818e-e78e62d137a5
    ```

1. Create other service principals related to Azure Virtual Desktop.

    To create a hosted machine, you must create the following Azure Virtual Desktop services in your tenant.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It's likely that the Azure Virtual Desktop service principals are already created in your tenant. If yes, you can skip this step.

    | Application name                   | Application ID                       |
    |------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | Azure Virtual Desktop              | 9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07 |
    | Azure Virtual Desktop Client       | a85cf173-4192-42f8-81fa-777a763e6e2c |
    | Azure Virtual Desktop ARM Provider | 50e95039-b200-4007-bc97-8d5790743a63 |

    Follow the same instruction as for creating the Windows 365 application to check and create the service principals.

### Get access to the default VM image

To create hosted machines, you need access to the default image that is part of your environment. You can view the default image in **Monitors** > **Machines** > **VM images (preview)**.

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/default-vm-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the default VM image in the VM images list.":::

Users need either the **System Administrator** or **Desktop Flow Machine Image Admin** role to see and manage the default image. For other users, the **System Administrator** or **Desktop Flow Machine Image Admin** needs to [share the default image](#share-the-default-image) with them before they can use it.

### Share the default image

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](http://powerautomate.com/).

1. Go to **Monitor** > **Machines** > **VM images (preview)**.

1. Select the default windows desktop image from the list.

1. Select **Manage access**.

> When a user isn't part of an environment anymore, you can continue to see it as a deactivated user. You'll be notified in the **Manage access** section of the image if it's shared with deactivated users. In this situation, remove access to them.

## Use custom VNet for your hosted machines

You can connect to your own virtual network (vNET) with your hosted machines to securely communicate with each other, the Internet, and on-premises networks. Providing your own vNET from your Azure subscription will allow your hosted machines to be provisioned with your vNET automatically.

### General network requirement

To use your own network and provision Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) joined hosted machines, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a virtual network (vNET) in your Azure subscription in the same region where you've created the hosted machines.
- Follow [Azureâ€™s Network guidelines](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/network-guidance).
- A subnet within the virtual network and available IP address space.

The vNET needs to be created in the same location with your hosted machines. You can find the following mapping with your environment Geo:

- US: East US
- Europe: North Europe
- Canada: Canada Central
- Australia: Australia East
- France: France Central
- India: Central India
- Japan: Japan East
- UK: UK South

### Share the virtual network with Windows 365 service principal

To use your virtual network for hosted machines, you'll need to grant Windows 365 service principal with the following permissions:

- Reader permission on the Azure subscription.
- Network contributor permission on the specified resource group.
- Network contributor permission on the virtual network.

## Share hosted machines

You can share your hosted machines with other users so they can run desktop flows with the creator's connection on them. To share a hosted machine:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](http://powerautomate.com/).

1. Go to **Monitor** > **Machines**.

1. Select the **Machines** tab.

1. Select a hosted machine in the list and navigate to the details page of it.

1. Select **Manage access**.

1. Enter the username or email you want to share the hosted machine with, and select the user you want to add.

1. For each user, you can grant different permissions: **User** or **Co-owner**.

    **User** permission only allows the targeted user to run desktop flows on the selected hosted machine. A **Co-Owner** can also edit the hosted machine details.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user isn't part of an environment anymore, you may continue to see the user as a deactivated user. You'll be notified in the **Manage access** section of the hosted machine if it's shared with deactivated users. In this situation, remove access to them.

## Run desktop flows on hosted machines

Power Automate enables you to trigger desktop flows on your hosted machines as you do on standard machines. To implement this functionality, you need a [desktop flow connection](desktop-flow-connections.md) to your hosted machine.

To find more information about triggering desktop flows from cloud flows, go to [Trigger desktop flows from cloud flows](link-pad-flow-portal.md).

## Permissions based on security roles

Hosted machine permissions and roles are iterations on top of [Desktop Flows Machine Management permissions and roles](manage-machines.md#update-permissions-based-on-security-role). A hosted machine group follows the same rules and privileges as a regular group.

### Creation of hosted machine and privileges

This section displays the permissions for hosted machines.

#### Environment Maker role

By default, **Environment Maker** role can create hosted machine in their environment. The entities that require privileges to use hosted machines are:

- Flow Machine
- Flow Machine Group
- Flow Machine Image
- Flow Machine Network (if using custom VNet for your hosted machine)

Environment Maker role can [create and share custom VM Images](#use-custom-vm-images-for-your-hosted-machine), as these actions require create and append privileges on the **Flow Machine Image**.

Environment Maker role can [create and share custom VNet](#use-custom-vnet-for-your-hosted-machines), as these actions require create and append privileges on the **Flow Machine Network**.

Admins can also use the roles provided as part of Desktop Flows. You can find more information about desktop flow security roles in [Manage Machines](manage-machines.md#update-permissions-based-on-security-role).

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/environment-maker-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Environment Maker role.":::

#### Desktop Flows Machine Owner role

By default, **Desktop Flows Machine owner** can create hosted machines, but can't create custom VM images or custom VNet. They can only use previously shared [custom VM images](#use-custom-vm-images-for-your-hosted-machine) or [custom VNets](#use-custom-vnet-for-your-hosted-machines) in their own hosted machine.

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/desktop-flows-machine-owner-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Desktop Flows Machine Owner role.":::

#### Desktop Flows Machine Configuration Admin role

The **Desktop Flows Machine Image Admin** role only brings full privileges on the **Flow Machine Image** and **Flow Machine Network** entities. In particular, it allows users with this role to share/unshare VM images and VNets to be used for created hosted machines in their environment. You can find more information about sharing pre-provisioned VM Images & VNets in [Create hosted machines](#create-a-hosted-machine).

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/desktop-flow-machine-configuration-admin-role.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permissions for the Desktop Flows Machine Configuration Admin role.":::

## Hosted machines limitations

This section presents all the limitation of hosted machines.

### Geographical availabilities/restrictions

The following list displays all the supported geographies in the public clouds:

- Australia
- Canada
- Europe
- France
- India
- Japan
- United Kingdom
- United States

Hosted machines aren't yet available in sovereign clouds and aren't yet available in the following public cloud geographies:

- Asia
- Brazil
- China
- Germany
- Korea
- Norway
- Switzerland
- United Arab Emirates

### Azure tenant country and supported geographies in the public cloud

During the public preview, a hosted machine can only be provisioned when the tenant's country on Azure falls within the same scope of the region for the Power Automate environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Your default Power Automate environment is created based on your Azure Active Directory Tenant's country.

To check the tenant country on Azure:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Open the **Tenant properties** service.
1. The **Country or region** is available as one of the properties.

:::image type="content" source="media/hosted-machines/tenant-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Country or region tenant property.":::

### Delete of unused resources

During the public preview, we clean unused resources to ensure the availability of our service for everyone. A hosted machine that has been inactive for 14 days may be automatically deleted. The deleted hosted machine will still be visible but can't be used anymore. An inactive hosted machine is a machine that has no flow runs and no usage of the Power Automate for desktop for the last 14 days.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to delete the inactive hosted machine and re-create a new one to continue using the hosted machines feature. You need to reconfigure the connections associated with your cloud flows.
