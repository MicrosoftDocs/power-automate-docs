# Use RPA with Dynamics 365 Finance

[Dynamics 365](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/) empowers your organization to deliver operational excellence and delight every customer. To make your use of Dynamics 365 even more productive and save users time and errors, we're releasing free automation solutions that let Dynamics 365 customers automate common tasks.

This article outlines the steps you need to automate end of cycle reporting in [Dynamics 365 Finance](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/finance/overview/) and focus on higher-priority activities that require your unique creativity.  

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you must prepare your environment with adequate licenses and software setup. This section provides step-by-step instructions about how to get the grounds ready.

### Software

You'll need to:

- [Install Power Automate](install.md). Power Automate will carry out the steps in Dynamics 365 as if a human were doing it in front of their computer.
- Set the appropriate file download configuration in Microsoft Edge to have complete automation.  
- Sign out of the Dynamics 365 app you wish to automate.
- Get the appropriate security role for the automation to run.

#### Set the appropriate file download configuration on Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge has two ways of downloading files from the internet onto your desktop:

1. It downloads directly on your machine, and saves the file in the destination folder specified in the Microsoft Edge settings.
2. It asks for the user’s permissions before downloading a file, waits for the user to accept the download, and then downloads and saves the file in the destination folder specified in the Microsoft Edge settings.  

To make this process fully automated and not require a human in front of the computer for it to work, you need Microsoft Edge to download files using the first mechanism.  

1. Launch Microsoft Edge on your machine.
1. Open the browser settings.
1. In the vertical menu in the left of your screen, select **Downloads**.
1. Disable the toggle **Ask me what to do with each download**.
1. Close your browser.

#### Sign out of the Dynamics 365 app

To accomplish the full automation, sign out of the application before running the automation for the first time. You need to do this step if you switch between automation and your account.  

#### Get the appropriate security role set up for the account running the automation

You need to decide which work account will run the automation. It can be a dedicated account created by your admin in Microsoft Entra ID or the account of an existing employee. Check that the chosen account has the appropriate security roles to access the surfaces you're automating. To find more information about security roles, go to [Managing security roles in Dynamics 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2127645).  

We recommend the following security roles:

|Application|Security role|Link to documentation|
|----|----|----|
|Power Platform|Environment admin or environment maker (if the environment already has Dataverse and unattended license needed)||
|Dynamic 365 Supply Chain Management||

### Licenses

If you already use Power Automate, PowerApps and Dynamics 365 applications on a day-to-day basis, you can skip this section and go to [Install the Dynamics 365 RPA solutions](#install-the-dynamics-365-rpa-solution).

Otherwise, you need at least a trial license for these three products. This section shows you how to acquire these trial licenses.

#### Get a trial license for Power Automate  

Power Automate can automate processes by doing what a human would do on a keyboard and screen.  

There are two ways to automate processes:

1. Attended mode: someone is sitting in front of their computer and watching the process run as if they were doing it manually.
1. Unattended mode: the process runs in the background on remote machines that users don’t see.

To run attended, users need to acquire the **Power Automate per-user license with RPA**. To run unattended, users need to have acquired two licenses: **Power Automate per-user license with RPA** and the **Power Automate unattended add-on**.

To get a trial license for **Power Automate per-user license with RPA**:

1. Go to the Power Automate portal, navigate to **My Flows** > **Desktop flows**.
1. Select **Start free trial now**

Alternatively, launch Power Automate for desktop and select **Start trial** on the console on the **Premium features** dialog.

To add a trial license for **Power Automate unattended add-on**:

1. As an admin, you can get an RPA unattended add-on and assign it to your environment. To find more information about the RPA unattended add-on, go to [Power Automate sign-up Q&A in your organization](../organization-q-and-a.md)  

#### Get a trial license for the Dynamics 365 applications you wish to automate

To get started with Dynamics 365 Finance and automate the end-of-cycle reporting process, go to [Discover how Dynamics 365 Finance can transform the way you do business](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/get-started/free-trial/?appname=finance).  

### Setup steps

Now that prerequisites are set, you are on your way to get the free solutions that automate your processes.

#### Install Power Automate  

1. Download and install Power Automate on the machine that will run the automation. You can find more information about Power Automate installation in [Install Power Automate](install.md).

1. Switch the Power Automate machine settings to the environment in which you'll install the solution.

1. Select **Directly to machine** in the **Connect** field. Then, select the machine name on which you've installed Power Automate, and enter the machine credential (the username and password you use to sign in to the machine. To find more information about direct connectivity, see [Manage machines](manage-machines.md).
