# Trigger a Power Automate desktop flow from another flow


## Prerequisites

- To trigger desktop flows through Power Automate, you have to use [machines](manage-machines.md) or [machine groups](manage-machine-groups.md). Machines are physical or virtual devices that are used to automate desktop processes. Machine groups allow you to organize multiple machines together to help distribute your automation workload.

   As an alternative to the machines, you can use the [on-premises data gateway](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820580&clcid=0x409). The gateway is an enterprise-grade secure connection between Power Automate and your device. 

- A work or school account. 

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >You must use the same work or school account to set up the gateway, to sign into Power Automate, and to log into your Windows device.
   

1. Go to **flow.microsoft.com** and sign in with your credentials. In Power Automate, select **My flows**. Select **+ New flow**, and from the drop-down select **Instant cloud flow**.

   Alternatively, you can select **Automated cloud flow** to create a flow that is triggered by a specific event, like the creation of a new file in an OneDrive for Business account.

1. Enter a name for the cloud flow, otherwise one will be automatically generated. Select **Manually trigger a flow** and then select **Create**.

1. A message from the browser may appear, asking whether to allow flow.microsoft.com to open an application. Allow this action to continue to Power Automate for desktop.

1. The Power Automate Console creates a desktop flow with the selected name and opens the flow designer to edit the new flow.

1. Optionally, create Input/output variables to pass data back and forth from the Power Automate web portal to Power Automate for desktop. In the Variables pane, select **+** to add an input or output variable.

   ![Screenshot of the option to create a new input variable.](\media\link-pad-flow-portal\new-input-output-var.png)

1. To create an input or output variable, the Edit variable dialog box will require filling in the fields as follows:
   * Variable type—input or output
   * Variable name—the name of the variable in flow designer
   * Default value—the value which the variable holds if none is assigned
   * Data type—the type of the variable (integer, string, datetime, and so on.)
   * External name—the name used outside flow designer. This name appears in Power    Automate.
   * Description—a description of the variable. This mandatory field appears in Power Automate
   * Mark as sensitive-enable this option to set the variable as sensitive and hide its content in the flow designer and the Power Automate logs.

1. Create an Input variable to pass data from Power Automate web portal to Power Automate for desktop. The variable can be used anywhere in the desktop flow.

1. To pass data from Power Automate for desktop to Power Automate web portal, create an Output variable.

1. Back in Power Automate, any input variables appear as fields in the UI action.

   ![Screenshot of the input variables in the Run a flow built with Power Automate Desktop action.](\media\link-pad-flow-portal\run-desktop-flow-v2-action-properties-2.png)

1. Output variables from Power Automate for desktop can be used in other Power Automate actions.
