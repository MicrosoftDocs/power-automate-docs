# Create custom forms

> [!NOTE]
> The **Display custom form** action is based on the Adaptive Cards technology. Refer to [this page](https://adaptivecards.io/) to find more information regarding Adaptive Cards. 

Message boxes enable you to prompt users to enter various inputs, such as text, dates, and files, or display information and results on the screen.

Although most actions of this group can handle scenarios where a single input is required, some automations may require a combination of inputs or/and outputs. The best approach to address these scenarios is the **Display custom form** action.

To create a custom form, deploy the **Display custom form** action and select the **Custom form designer** button to open the form designer.

On the left side of the designer, there's a list with all the [available input elements](#custom-form-elements) you can add to the form, such as text, date, and file inputs, and some non-interactive elements, such as texts and images. 

To add an element to the custom form, double-click it or drag and drop it in the designer's workspace area. Use the preview pane on the bottom part of the form designer to see how the configured form will look during runtime. 

After adding an element, you can handle all the [available properties](#custom-form-element-properties) on the right side of the form designer. The available properties may differ depending on the nature of the selected element. 

> [!NOTE]
> Apart from the form elements, the form designer provides some properties to configure the appearance of the parent dialog of the custom form. To configure them, select an empty space on the workspace and see the available properties on the respective pane.

When a user populates a custom form, the provided data are stored into the **CustomFormData** custom object variable. To access the value of a specific input element stored in the custom object, use the following notation: **%CustomFormData['ElementID']%**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ID of each element must be unique and can't be empty. Also, it must start with a letter and can contain Latin letters, numbers and spaces. You can't use variables in ID fields. If an invalid ID is provided, the last used valid ID will be automatically restored after closing and saving the form designer.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find more information regarding custom objects and how to handle them in [Advanced data types](variable-data-types.md#advanced-data-types).

Apart from input and non-interactive elements, the form designer provides some actions to implement additional functionality in your forms.

Consider actions as buttons that allow you to run different functions based on which button was pressed. For example, use a **Submit** action as a save button to gather and store the provided user data for later use in your flow.

> [!NOTE]
> Actions can be added only at the end of the form structure, after any other type of form element. 

Like the other elements, each action has an ID that describes it uniquely. When an action is selected, its ID is stored into the **ButtonPressed** variable.

When a form contains multiple actions, use this variable and [conditionals](use-conditionals.md) to check which one is pressed and implement different functionality for each scenario. To find more information on implementing this behavior, refer to [Handle custom forms](how-to/handle-custom-forms.md).  

The following screenshot shows how the previously configured custom form looks when the flow runs.

| Weight | N/A | Default, Lighter, Bolder | Default | Controls the weight of text |
| Width in pixels | No | Numeric value | 0 | The desired on-screen width of the image. This overrides the 'Size' property. The default value of 0 determines that no particular width is specified |
| Wrap | N/A | Boolean value | False | If enabled, allows text to wrap. Otherwise, text is clipped |

## Known issues and limitations 

- **Issue:** The preview pane seems to work as expected when the URL property contains percentage characters, but an **Invalid value** validation error occurs. 

 - **Workaround:** This issue happens because Power Automate attempts to resolve the percentage characters as variables or expressions. To resolve this case, store the URL in a variable earlier in the flow, [escape the percentage characters](variable-manipulation.md), and then use that variable in the URL property. The preview won't show the image, but it will be shown during runtime.
