# Create desktop flows

Using Power Automate, you can develop desktop flows that automate tasks on your desktop and the Web. This section presents all the available ways to create desktop flows and start designing your automations.

## Start creating desktop flows using examples

Power Automate provides an extensive collection of examples to introduce users to RPA. You can find all the available examples under the **Examples** tab in the console.

To copy an example to your flows, right-click the example and select **Create a copy**. The copied flow will be stored under the **My flows** tab.

If you've opened and edited an example in the flow designer, select **Save as** to copy the edited example to your flows. The changes can't be saved to the original example flow.
