# Prerequisites and limitations

This article presents all the prerequisites and limitations you should consider before installing and using Power Automate on your desktop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Selenium IDE is deprecated and will no longer work after February 28th, 2023.
> - Windows recorder (V1) is deprecated and no longer works.
> - Migrate your flows created with these solutions to Power Automate for desktop or delete them.

## Prerequisites

- An account with administrator privileges to [install Power Automate](install.md) using the MSI installer
  - If you install it from the Microsoft Store, a standard Windows account is acceptable.

- An account to sign in to Power Automate
  - [Learn what features are available for each account type](#sign-in-account-comparison).

- A device with the following hardware (these requirements don't include the resources required for the applications involved in your desktop flows):

  > [!NOTE]
  > The following hardware requirements apply only to single-user sessions with Power Automate for desktop open.

  Minimum hardware:
  - Processor: 1.00 GHz or faster with two or more cores. For unattended mode, four or more cores are needed.
  - Storage: 1 GB
  - RAM: 2 GB

  Recommended hardware:
  - Processor: 1.60 GHz or faster with two or more cores. For unattended mode, four or more cores are needed.
  - Storage: 2 GB
  - RAM: 4 GB
  - GPU acceleration
  - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later

- A device that runs Windows 10 (Home, Pro, Enterprise), Windows 11 (Home, Pro, Enterprise), Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2022 (devices with ARM processors aren't supported)

    If your device runs Windows 10 Home or Windows 11 Home, you can use Power Automate to create desktop flows and monitor them on the [Power Automate portal](https://make.powerautomate.com). However, you can't trigger desktop flows from the cloud and run other types of desktop flows (Windows recorder V1 and Selenium IDE).

## Known issues and limitations

- Only work or school account users with a Dataverse database provisioned in their default environment can create Power Automate desktop flows. Power Automate desktop flows are stored in the default environment with the Dataverse database.

  If the Dataverse database doesn't exist in the default environment, the user won't be able to create desktop flows, and will be prompted to create a database. There will be no connectivity of Power Automate desktop flows with cloud flows.â€¯ 

  After users create the Dataverse in the Power platform admin center, they might be prompted to create it again. In this scenario, exit Power Automate for desktop from the system tray icon and restart it.

- If users have signed in with trial or paid accounts and want to connect their free Microsoft accounts, they must use Power Automate for desktop version 2.6.48.21069 or above. Otherwise, they'll encounter the following error:  

    :::image type="content" source="media\known-issues\pad-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sign-in window with error.":::

- Power Automate applies the proxy configuration specified in Windows proxy settings. If the proxy server requires authentication, the administrator must exclude Power Automate from using it or use another server that doesn't require authentication. Learn more about [configuring Power Automate to bypass a corporate proxy server](governance.md#configure-power-automate-for-desktop-to-bypass-a-corporate-proxy-server).

- The number of actions that can be logged in a single desktop flow run is limited to 10,000. Extra actions will be performed but won't be logged.

- Power Automate for desktop is fully backwards compatible. However, forward compatibility isn't guaranteed. Each update might introduce action upgrades that change their signature (properties or values of an action) and/or a change in the engine powering runtime and authoring. Attempting to run or edit a desktop flow created with a newer version of Power Automate for desktop might result in the following error message:

"This flow has been generated by a newer Power Automate version than the one currently installed. Download and install the latest version of Power Automate and try again."

To resolve this issue, edit and run the flow with the version that was used to create or edit it, or use a newer version of Power Automate for desktop.
