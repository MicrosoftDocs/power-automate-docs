# Create desktop flow connections

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using a machine to run desktop flows from the cloud, ensure that the machine is secured and the machine's admins are trusted.

Before using the **Run desktop flow** action in your cloud flow to trigger a desktop flow, you need to create a connection to your machine. To create a connection:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), go to **Data** > **Connections**,  and then select **New connection**.

1. Search for **Desktop flows**, and then select the appropriate result.

> [!NOTE]
> Desktop flows connection cannot be shared with other users.

There's two different methods to connect Power Automate with your machines (or groups).

## Connect with username and password

With this option, you need to provide the machine (or on-premises data gateway) information and device credentials:

   - **Connect**: Select if you want to connect to a machine or a machine group.

      To connect to a machine or a machine group, select **Connect with username and password**, and choose the appropriate machine or machine group in  **Machine or machine group**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/desktop-flows-setup/choose-machine.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Directly to machine option in the Connect field.":::

   - **Domain and Username**: Provide your device account. To use a local account, populate the name of the user (for example, **MACHINENAME\\User** or **local\\User**) or an Active Directory account, such as **DOMAIN\\User** or **username@domain.com**

   - **Password**: Your accountâ€™s password.

## Connect with sign-in for attended runs

With this option, you don't need to provide session credentials. This might be very helpful when your organization doesn't allow username and password for user sessions.

### Prerequisites

To use connection with sign-in, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

  - Microsoft Entra users must be in the same tenant as the selected environment in Power Automate portal.
  - The target (machine / group) should be Microsoft Entra ID or AD joined. In case of an Entra ID joined target, the machine or group must be synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID.
  - The Microsoft Entra user account must be granted right to open a Windows session on the target machines (interactive sign in). At runtime, there should a Windows interaction session matching the connection user in order to process the run (as it's today for existing connections).
  - The tenant of the target Microsoft Entra account is configured to use modern authentication [Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

> [!NOTE]
> Connect with sign-in for attended runs is available in most of the Power Platform regions.
> For GCCH, DOD, and China regions, the feature requires the December version of Power Automate for desktop app.
> Currently, GCC isn't supported.


### Set up the connection with sign-in

- Select **Connect with Sign-in** in the Connect dropdown
- Select the target (machine or machine group)
- Select **Sign in**
- Pick or provide an **Microsoft Entra account** in the sign in pop-up 
- The desktop flow connect is automatically created

### How it works
- An access / refresh token is created during the Microsoft Entra authentication.
- The token scope is limited to executing a desktop flow.
- The Power Platform services manage the refreshment of those tokens.

### Limitations
- Connect with sign-in (preview) works **only for attended runs**. Running unattended with this connection will always fail.
- Queue time duration is limited to one hour.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you consistently encounter issues when creating a connection on a new machine, first try to remove it, and then [register it](/power-automate/desktop-flows/manage-machines#register-a-new-machine) again.
