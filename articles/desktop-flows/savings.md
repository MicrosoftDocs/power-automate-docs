# Savings in Power Automate (Preview)

The savings feature provides a way to calculate how much time and/or money a cloud flow is saving to its organization. Each cloud flow can now be added a user-defined saving-rule which generates savings at successful cloud flow runs.

|Concept|Definition|
|----|-------------------------------------------|
|Saving rule|The artifact attached to the cloud flow which bears the user-define saving baselines.|
|Savings|The amount of time/money saved generated by the saving rule for the cloud flow.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> Savings is only supported by solution-based cloud flows
> Only successful runs will generate savings (successful test runs don't)

## How to set-up a saving rule

The saving rule can be defined on the cloud flow details page by clicking on the **savings icon** in the page action bar which opens the saving-rule edition dialog:

|Saving-rule|Definition|
|----|-------------------------------------------|
|Time saving rule|Define the manual processing time it usually takes to manually perform the actions being automated. The saving can be generated either on every successful run or once every hour/day/week if a successful run happened in that period.|
|Money-saving rule based on hourly rate|The money-saving rule can be based on an hourly rate converting time-savings in money-savings. This mode is only available if the time-saving rule is enabled.|
|Money-saving rule with user-defined baseline|Define the amount of money saved by the actions being automated. The saving can also be generated either on every successful run or once every hour/day/week if a successful run happened in that period.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> Money-saving rule based on hourly rate: the money-savings generated are rounded and don't save decimals. For example the user defines a time-saving baseline of 1 hour and 15 minutes per successful run and an hourly rate of 1$/hour, the money-saving associated should be 1.25$ on a successful run but it will be rounded to 1$.

## When are savings generated

Once a saving-rule is saved on a cloud flow, every succesful run of this flow will contribute to generate savings. But the saving is not immediately generated after the successful run: a periodic update of the saving amount for the cloud flow is automatically performed. It can take up to one hour for a run to be accounted for in the savings amount of its cloud flow.

## How can you track the savings generated by your cloud flow

You can visualize the saving generated by a cloud flow on the flow details page :

And if you click on the savings-card **See trend** link, you will, access the Automation Center savings pane where you will be able to track the saving trend of this flow and all other flows:

## Frequently asked questions

### Why is the hourly-rate mode disabled in the money-rule section?

The money-rule can only use the hourly-rate mode if the time-saving rule is enabled.

### Why is the money rule entirely disabled?

Your environment administrator has blocked the usage of money rule in the environment. Any money-saving that was generated before the administrator decision will remain on the cloud flows but no new money-savings will be generated.

## Permissions required to view and edit saving-rules

To view and edit a saving-rule, you need a security role with privileges to the **Saving Rule** and the **Flow Aggregation** tables. For example, the Environment Maker role can view and edit saving-rules on its cloud flows.
