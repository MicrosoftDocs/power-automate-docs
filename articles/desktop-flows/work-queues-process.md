# Process work queues

Work queue processing refers to the management of a list of work items that need to be completed in a particular order. This list contains information about each item, such as its name, priority, expiration date, status, and the actual value to be processed.

## Processing walkthroughs

To showcase some of the available processing options, here are three different processing scenarios.

### Desktop flow-based work queue processing in Power Automate desktop (PAD)

#### Process work queue items & Update examples

The first step to using work queue actions in Power Automate desktop is to create a work queue in the environment that you're working in and load some queue items with data to be consumed downstream. Queue items can be loaded into a work queue through a desktop flow, cloud flow or in bulk as outlined [here](work-queues-bulk-import.md), which populates queue items. In this example, some queue items have been added manually into a work queue to explain how actions in Power Automate desktop can be used.

The work queue items have been created and the value field includes text in JSON format that will be used downstream in the desktop flow.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-padwqitems.png" alt-text="Screenshot of work queue items available to be processed in Power Automate desktop." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-padwqitems.png":::

The example flow we'll be using to demonstrate work queue action usage mimics a process that would consume a work queue item from the cloud, process the data included in the value field and convert it to a custom object to be processed downstream. Note that it isn't mandatory to use JSON or custom objects as values for your work queue items, but it can be a useful method for organizing values that have multiple properties and follow a specific schema.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-df.png" alt-text="Screenshot of desktop flow process used for this tutorial." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-df.png":::

1. The **Process work queue items** action is used to designate which work queue to consume items from and process in your desktop flow.  The action can be configured to select a work queue from a list using the dropdown arrow, pass a variable including the queue name. When run, this action works by bringing in the first (oldest) item from the work queue into your flow that contains a status of **queued**. Once the queue item begins processing in your flow, its status automatically changes to **processing**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-procwqiaction-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the WorkQueueItem action configured to process queue items in Power Automate desktop." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-procwqiaction-new.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqirocessing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of work queue item in **processing** state." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqirocessing.png":::

1. A [breakpoint](debugging-flow.md#adding-breakpoints) (red dot) was set by clicking next to action 3 in the flow and then run through the PAD console.  When the process pauses at the breakpoint, the **WorkQueueItem** variable can be opened by double clicking the populated value under **Flow variables** and this shows all the properties associated with the work queue item being processed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqvarvalue.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the WorkQueueItem variable in the variable viewer." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqvarvalue.png":::

1. In action 2 of the flow, I converted the returned JSON value, which in this case is accessed via %WorkQueueItem.Value% into a custom object.  The reason for this is because it helps parse the JSON and use the JSON properties downstream in your flow.  In this hypothetical case, the info would be used to make entries into Farbrikam’s finance portal.

   ```json
   {
    "InvoiceId": "I-1006",
    "InvoiceDate": "06/04/2023",
    "AccountName": "Fabrikam",
    "ContactEmail": "invoicing@fabrikam.com",
    "Amount": 1253.78,
    "Status": "Paid",
    "WorkQueueKey": "Vendor Invoices",
    "ComponentState": 0,
    "OverwriteTime": "1900-01-01T00:00:00"
   }
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-jsonascustomobject.png" alt-text="Screenshot of JSON value converted into a custom object." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-jsonascustomobject.png":::

   For instance, let's say there was a requirement to enter the invoice ID into a field of a finance system as part of a process where you're automating the UI of a web or desktop app – you can call that value using **%JsonAsCustomObject.InvoiceId%** to populate a text field and push a button.

1. Moving along, this example contains some conditional statements once it completes processing the steps and uses the data from the custom object within the subflow Fabrikam Data Entry.  If the process runs end-to-end without encountering any input system related exceptions the **Update work queue item** action is used to change the status of the work queue item to **Processed** and the **processing result** field can be used to input some optional notes. If the **expires** field is left blank, the new queue item retains the *Items expire after* value defined in the work queue properties.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-updatewqi.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of update work queue item action inputs." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-updatewqi.png":::

   Exception handling options can be configured by clicking **on error** in the **update work queue item** action configuration window.  Three options are available for customization under the advanced tab.  **Work queue item not found** might occur if the work queue item is removed from the queue, either manually or through another systematic process, before it finishes processing in PAD.  **Work queue item on hold** might occur if an automated process, or somebody changes the status of the work queue item being processed to **on hold** in the flow portal while the queue item is being processed.  **Failed to update work queue item** might occur if the queue item no longer exists in the queue, or has been placed into the status **on hold**. All the above are edge cases, which might occur - [learn more about handling errors in desktop flows here](errors.md).

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-updatewqiexc.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of update work queue item action exception handling." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-updatewqiexc.png":::

1. If some issue was determined during processing the data of the work queue item into the data entry system, the item could alternatively be assigned a status of **generic exception, IT exception, or business exception**.  These exceptions statuses are available to be used when, or if, your automated use case meets criteria, which might apply.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqiconditional.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of conditional statement used to update the current work queue item in the desktop flow and add a new queue item into an alternative queue to handle exceptions." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqiconditional.png":::

   Let’s say that while processing a queue item, scenario 2 was met.  In this case, the queue item is marked as generic exception in the originating queue.  Depending on the scenario, you might decide to change the status of queue items, which couldn't be processed successfully as one of the alternative status options. From there, you can decide whether human intervention is required, or build a subsequent process with the logic required to manage each exception status.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqiresults.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of updated status for work queue items processed in the flow portal." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqiresults.png":::

#### Auto-retry pattern

The **Process work queue items** action in Power Automate Desktop includes an advanced option to configure or override an auto-retry mechanism. This feature allows you to specify the maximum auto-retry count per work queue item, which is useful for handling IT exceptions like transient network errors or temporary system unavailability. It enables the machine to retain the item and perform controlled retries without requeuing the item, ensuring more efficient and resilient work queue processing.

You can set and centrally control the maximum retry count on the work queue record in Dataverse. This default value applies to all desktop flows that process this work queue through the **Process Work Queue Items** action.

To override the queue-level default in your flow, navigate to the **Advanced** section of the **Process work queue items** action, and toggle the **Override work queue auto-retry configuration** option. This setting lets you adjust the maximum retry count to a higher or lower value, or even disable the retry mechanism by setting the max retry count to 0.

When you use the **Update work queue item** action with a status set to `IT exception` and a max auto-retry count greater than 0, the system doesn't immediately send the update to the work queue orchestrator. Instead, it retries the operation until it reaches the specified max retry count. The only value updated in the work queue item is the `retrycount`. This value increases from the second update attempt onwards until the max auto-retry count is reached. Additionally, a local work queue item variable called `CurrentRetryCount` increments with each retry. This variable allows you to implement custom logic based on its value if needed.

:::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-procwqiaction.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the WorkQueueItem action configured to process queue items with advance max retry count set in Power Automate desktop." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-procwqiaction.png":::

The flow won't request a new item when it loops back to the top of the **Process work queue items** action if the following conditions are met:

* The maximum retry count is not reached.
* No other updates occur except for IT exceptions.

When the max retry count is reached, the update action sends the update to the orchestrator, changing the item's status to IT Exception and including any provided processing notes.

#### Adding and requeuing work queue items examples from PAD

The **Add work queue item** enables desktop flow users to populate work queue items into a work queue, which has been set up in the flow portal. Batch item creation is supported by using the [**Add work queue items**](actions-reference/workqueues.md#add-multiple-work-queue-items) action.

In this example, an Excel file in .csv is dropped into a directory on a daily basis and each row needs to be added to a work queue.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqiprocesspng.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of process incorporating the add work queue item action." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqiprocesspng.png":::

The first couple of actions in this sample process map a folder where the daily Contoso Invoices.csv file is dropped - when the process runs it begins by reading the data table from the CSV file.  The **CSVTable variable** contains the data, which has been imported and will be processed to new queue items.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-CSVtable.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of data imported from a CSV file." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-CSVtable.png":::

Actions 3 and 4 generate the time at which we choose the new queue items to expire after being added into a work queue.  Action 3 captures the current system data and time, then for this example 7 days are added onto it by using the **%Add to datetime%** action.  The output is stored into a variable called **ExpiryDatetime** which will be used in the **Add work queue item** action.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addtodatetime.png" alt-text="Screenshot example for adding to the current datetime to set an expiry datetime." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addtodatetime.png":::

Action 5 introduces the **For each** loop, which is used to iterate through each row of data in the imported **CSVTable** - this action renders a data row for the current item being processed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqidatarow.png" alt-text="Screenshot example for data row generated for each loop." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-wqidatarow.png":::

All of the preceding actions in this example desktop flow are now incorporated into setting the values for the **Add work queue item** action.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqi.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of add work queue item action configured in the desktop flow." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqi.png":::

The **work queue** parameter is set to the queue that we want to add new work queue items into - in this case **Demo PAD queue** was selected by choosing it from the dropdown menu.  

The **Priority** parameter is left at the default, **Normal**, but options for **Low** and **High** are also optional.  Higher priority work queue items are processed first, then normal and last when mixed into the same work queue.

The **Name** parameter has been set with a static prefix along with the variable value **CurrentItem['ID']** - which contains the value from the ID cell of the data row being processed.  This is optional but can be useful depending on your use case.

Using the values from the data row in the variable **CurrentItem** the **Input** parameter was entered in JSON format.  Note each header name was appended to the **currentitem** variable using the notation **['name of header']**

The **Expires** field is populated with the datetime variable we added 7 days onto in the previous steps.  When left blank, the work queue item being added will contain the *Items expire after* value set for the work queue.

**Processing notes** are optional - use as deemed necessary.

When the process is run, each data row in the imported CSV creates a work queue item containing a **Queued** status, which means it's available for processing.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqiinportal.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of work queue items visible in the portal containing a queued status." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-pad-addwqiinportal.png":::

These are just some of many ways that work queue actions can be used in PAD.  Take some time to explore and find creative uses to incorporate work queues into your Power Automate flows!

#### Requeue item with delay example

The **Requeue item with delay** action enables desktop flow users to requeue items and set a delay period at which time the item it can be released again for processing.

In this example, there's a work queue loaded with items, which are set to expire in 24 hours, but they can't be processed in time because there's some ongoing routine system maintenance being performed by IT and the items need to be requeued.  The maintenance will be completed overnight, so we'll proceed to delay each queue item by 24 hours and then set them to expire 24 hours after the release period.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-process.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of process utilizing requeue item and add delay action." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-datetime.png":::

The first three actions of this example process are date time actions. The 'Get current date and time' action captures the system datetime at the moment the action is run.  Next we used the 'Add to datetime' action to cover two requirements, first we need to define the delay time by adding 24 hours to the current datetime - then we need to add 48 hours to the current datetime as an expiry.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-datetime.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of capturing system datetime." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-datetime.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-delay.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of adding to the datetime to create a delay." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-delay.png":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-expire.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of adding to the datetime to create an expiry time." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue-expire.png":::

Next in the example, the 'Process work queue items' action is configured to point to the loaded work queue and the 'Requeue item with delay' is placed within the loop.

   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue.png" alt-text="Screenshot example of requeue item with delay." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-requeue.png":::

The values generated for the delay and the expiry can now be passed into the 'Requeue item with delay' action.  The 'work queue item' field is populated by the variable produced by the loop - this instructs which queue item to requeue.  Next we plugged in the values created using the datetime actions for the 'delay until' and 'expires' fields.  The 'delay until' is mandatory, but you can use 'expires' and 'processing result' at your discretion.  

With this simple process, you can requeue all available items in a queue, delay them for a certain time, with options to also set an expiration date and processing result.

### Cloud flow and connector-based processing

The simplest way to dequeue a work queue item and process it is as follows:

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) and sign in with your credentials.

1. On the left menu, select **My flows**.

1. On the toolbar, select **+ New flow** and then select **Instant cloud flow**.

1. Provide a **Flow name**, such as *My first work queue flow*, and then select **Manually trigger a flow**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Once the flow designer opens, select **+ New step,** and then select the Microsoft Dataverse connector.

1. In the list of actions, select **Perform a bound action**.

  | Parameter | Value | Description                    |
  | --------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
  | **Table name** | Work Queues | The name of the work queue table. |
  | **Action name** | Dequeue | The action, which gets the next available item from the queue.|
  | **Row ID** | *[Work Queue ID]* | The work queue ID (GUID) of the queue you'd like to dequeue from. You can get to this value by navigating to the work queue details page of your queue and opening the **Advanced details** panel. |
  
  :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-advanced-fields.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a work queue details page with the work queue ID highlighted in the browser URL bar." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-advanced-fields.png":::

  > [!NOTE]
  > A bound action is a Dataverse action that is defined on a specific table (work queues in our example) and can only be executed on records of that table. Bound actions are used by the platform to perform custom business logic or operations on a specific record.

1. Your flow should look similar to this now.

  :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-101.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a flow action that shows parameters for the dequeue action." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-101.png":::

1. Select **Save** and then **Test** your flow.

1. In the testing side-pane select **Manually**, **Test**, **Run flow** and then **Done**.

1. If the flow ran successfully, you should get a similar result (but with different IDs).

  :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-return-101.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a cloud flow designer with an active and successful run including the results of a dequeue action." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-return-101.png":::

1. Next, copy the whole JSON content from the **body** field and then select **Edit** in the upper right corner of the flow.

  > [!TIP]
  > After dequeuing a work queue item, use the JSON content of the item as a schema example for parsing the item's JSON properties. This allows you to easily access any property of the item returned by the work queue orchestrator in subsequent flow actions.

1. Add a new step by selecting **+ New step** and search for an action called **Parse JSON** and select it.

  :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-parsejson.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a cloud flow designer that shows the parse json action selected." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-parsejson.png":::

1. Position your mouse in the **Content** field and select the **body** property from the previous action.

  :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-jsonschema.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a cloud flow designer that shows the parse json action with a content value set to body."lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-jsonschema.png":::

1. Next, select **Generate from sample** and paste the previously copied JSON string into the dialog and select **Done**.

1. Select **+ New step** and then select the **Microsoft Dataverse** connector.

1. From the list of actions, select **Update a row**.

1. In the **Table name** field, select the **Work Queue Items** table and position your cursor in the **Row ID** field.

1. In the **Dynamic content** list, you'll now have all fields that are available in the work queue item table.

1. Select **Show advanced options** and then set the **RowID**, **Processing Result**, **Status**, and **Status Reason** fields to the following values.
  
  | Field | Value | Details                    |
  | --------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
  | **Row ID** | workqueueitemid | This value can be selected in the dynamic content list dialog. |
  | **Processing Result** | The item has been successfully processed. | |
  | **Status** | Processed | |
  | **Status Reason** | Processed | |
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-update.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a cloud flow designer that shows update a row action of the Dataverse connector with work queue item values." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-update.png":::

1. Select **Save** and **Test** the flow once more.

1. If the flow ran successfully, you should get a similar result as the following.  
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-flow-done.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a cloud flow run that completed successfully." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-flow-done.png":::

1. Now, navigate to the work queue details page and in the work queue item list section select **See all**.

1. Filter the **Status** field to only show **Processing** and **Processed** items to confirm that our dequeue and update actions worked as expected.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of work queue items See all experience that is about to be filtered by status." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter.png":::
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter-active.png" alt-text="Screenshot of work queue items filter experience where processing and processed filter options have been selected." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter-active.png":::
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the filter results, showing two records that matched the previously set filter criteria." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-dequeue-filter-complete.png":::  

   Congratulations, you just completed your first work queue processing scenario!

### Cloud flow-based processing with desktop flow support

For this scenario, we extend the previous one by adding a desktop flow processing step as well.

1. Go back and edit the *My first work queue flow*.
1. Add a new action right after the **Parse JSON** action and search for **Desktop flows** connector and the **Run a flow built with Power Automate for desktop**.
1. In the desktop flow dropdown, either choose and edit an existing desktop flow or select **+ Create a new desktop flow** and follow the instruction on screen to create the desktop flow and launch Power Automate for desktop. If you're new to desktop flows, you can learn more [here](create-flow.md).
1. Once the Power Automate for desktop designer opens, create two **input** variables called **WorkQueueItemValue** and **WorkQueueItemName** and then add two **output** variables called **ProcessingNotes** and **ProcessingStatus** respectively, all of which should have **Text** as their data type.  
1. Provide a default value for the **WorkQueueItem** variable so that you can later test the script locally. In case you've followed the [bulk-import tutorial](work-queues-bulk-import.md#tutorial-import-a-work-queue-and-items-from-csv) you should have work queue items in the **Vendor** invoice queue that have their values in JSON format. Here's an example of one of the values used.

   ```json
   {
    "InvoiceId": "I-1006",
    "InvoiceDate": "06/04/2023",
    "AccountName": "Fabrikam",
    "ContactEmail": "invoicing@fabrikam.com",
    "Amount": 1253.78,
    "Status": "Paid",
    "WorkQueueKey": "Vendor Invoices",
    "ComponentState": 0,
    "OverwriteTime": "1900-01-01T00:00:00"
   }
   ```
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/work-queues/work-queue-hybrid-pad-variables.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a desktop flow designer that shows input and output actions." lightbox="media/work-queues/work-queue-hybrid-pad-variables.png":::

1. Now, **Save** the flow.
1. In the action panel, open the **Variables** action group and double-click the **Convert JSON to custom object** action to add it to the design canvas, which opens its property window.
1. Select the variable icon in the JSON field and choose the **WorkQueueItemValue** variable.
1. Rename the produced output variable from **JsonAsCustomObject** to **VendorInvoice** and select **Save**.
1. Next, add an **If** action from the **Conditionals** group and configure its properties as follows:
  
   | First operand  | Operator | Second operand  |
   |----------------|----------|-----------------|
   | %VendorInvoice['Amount']% | Less than (<) | 5000 |

1. Select **Save**.
1. Add another action from the **Conditionals** group called **Else** and add it between the **If** and **End** action.
1. Now, add another two actions from the **Variables** group called **Set variable** and add them within the **If** and **Else** actions and set the **ProcessingNotes** and **ProcessingStatus** variables to the following values:
  
   | Variable           | Value                         |
   |--------------------|-------------------------------|
   | %ProcessingNotes%  | The invoice has been processed |
   | %ProcessingStatus% | Processed |

1. Copy the two **Set variable** action and paste them between the **Else** and the **End** action and change their values to match these:
  
   | Variable           | Value                         |
   |--------------------|-------------------------------|
   | %ProcessingNotes%  | Business exception: The invoice amount is greater than $5000, which requires manager approval. |
   | %ProcessingStatus% | Exception |

1. Your flow should look similar to this now.

1. **Save** the flow and run it to confirm that the flow logic works as expected.
1. Go back to edit the *My first work queue flow*.
1. Select the newly created (or edited) desktop flow from the list and then select **Attended** as its **Run Mode**.
1. Fill in the **Work Queue Item Value** and **Work Queue Item Name** parameters as shown here:

1. Add a **Condition** action before the **Update a row** action.
1. Position your mouse in the **Choose a value** field and select **Processing Status** from the dynamic content list dialog.
1. Position your mouse in the other **Choose a value** field and enter **Processed** as the text value.
1. Drag and drop the **Update a row** action into the **If yes** section of the condition action.
1. Open the **Update a row** action details and replace the values to match the following:
