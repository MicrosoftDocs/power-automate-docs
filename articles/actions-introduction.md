# Actions overview

*Actions* are the events you want the flow to do after the [trigger](triggers-introduction.md) event takes place. To save a cloud flow, it must have at least a trigger and one action.

Power Automate offers a variety of actions that you can use in your cloud flows. There are three main categories:

- AI capabilities
- Built-in tools
- By connector

Here's a screenshot of a partial list of actions:

- **AI Capabilities**: (Need better definition) All AI capabilities are uplevelled in this standalone section.
- **Built-in tools**: Building blocks to your flow if you want to store values in a variable, insert a loop, and more.
- **By connector**: Connect to services such as SharePoint and Outlook. Most connectors offer prebuilt actions that you can use in your flows.
