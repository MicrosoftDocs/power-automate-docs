# Respond to personal data discovery requests (Microsoft account)

The first step in responding to personal data requests is to find personal data that's subject to the request. This step helps you to determine whether a request meets your organization's requirements for honoring or declining the request.

The following table summarizes the Power Automate resources that may contain the personal data of a user who authenticates using a Microsoft account.

| **Resource** | **Purpose** |
| ----- | ----- |
| Run history | The history of each flow execution for the past 28 days, including the start time, end time, status, and all inputs and outputs. [Learn more](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/download-history-recurrence/). |
| Activity feed | Recaps flow activities, including run status, failures, and notifications. |
| Flows | The workflow logic that exists for a cloud flow. [Learn more](./get-started-logic-flow.md). |
| Connections | Used by connectors to share data with APIs, systems, databases, etc. [Learn more](./add-manage-connections.md). |
