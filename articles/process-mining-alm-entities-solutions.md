# Migrate ALM process mining entities with Power Platform solutions

Application lifecycle management (ALM) in Process Mining allows you to migrate your process mining entities with Power Platform solutions. To complete the migration, you need to create and export your solution in your Dev environment. Then, you need to change to your Test environment to import it.

The source and target of your process mining artifacts determine which environment you need to use:

- **Dev environment**: The environment *from* which you want to port artifacts.
- **Test environment**: The environment *to* which you want to port artifacts.

## Create and export your solution

Create and export your process solution in the Dev environment.

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. Select your Dev environment.
1. On the left navigation menu, select **Process mining** and create your process.

    For instructions, go to [Create a process](process-mining-tutorial.md#create-a-process).

1. On the navigation menu, select **Solutions**.

    If **Solutions** doesn't appear on the menu, select **More** > **Solutions**.

1. Create a new solution with the following steps:
    1. On the menu bar at the top, select **+New solution**.
    1. In the **Display name** field, enter the name to display.
    1. In the **Publisher** dropdown menu, select a publisher.

        If you want to edit the selected publisher, select the pencil icon next to the dropdown menu.

    1. In the **Version** field, enter a version (for example, 1.0.0.0).

1. At the bottom of the screen, select **Create**.
1. On the menu bar at the top, select **Add existing** > **More** > **Other** > **PM Inferred Task**.
1. From the **Add existing PM Inferred Task** list, select the process you created and want to migrate to the Test environment, and then select **Add**.
1. On the navigation menu, select the back arrow to go to the **Solutions** screen. You should now see the solution you created.
1. Select your solution, and then select **Export solution** on the menu at the top.
1. On the **Before you export** screen, select **Publish**.
1. When all customizations are published, select **Next**.

## Download and import your exported solution

Below the menu at the top, a green message bar appears to indicate your export was successful. It also contains a button for you to download the exported folder.

1. From the green message bar, select **Download**.
1. Go to your Test environment.
1. On the left navigation menu, select **Solutions**.
1. Import the solution with the following steps.
    1. On the menu bar at the top, select **Import solution**.
    1. On the **Import a solution** screen, select **Browse**.
    1. From your file explorer, select the solution you downloaded.
    1. Select **Next**.
    1. Select **Import**.

    After the solution successfully imports, your process appears on the Process Mining homepage with an orange exclamation mark inside a speech bubble.

1. To complete the import, select your solution and follow the **Setup** process.

## Update entities in your Test environment

You can update entities in your Test environment by upgrading or updating your solution. To learn more, go to [Apply the upgrade or update in the target environment](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/update-solutions#apply-the-upgrade-or-update-in-the-target-environment).

To learn more about solutions, go to [Solution concepts](/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm).
