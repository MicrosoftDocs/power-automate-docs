# Cancel or resubmit flow runs in bulk

You can cancel or resubmit your flow runs in bulk instead of one at a time, which can be a huge time saver.

## Resubmit flow runs

You can resubmit previous runs of a flow in bulk. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. On the left panel, select **My flows**.
1. On the right panel, select the cloud flow that you would like to resubmit or cancel.
1. Select **All runs**.

   > [!TIP]
   > - The flow must have runs to cancel or resubmit the flow runs.
   > - You can resubmit or cancel up to 20 flows at a time.

1. Select the flow runs that you would like to resubmit or cancel on the **Run history** page.
1. Select **Resubmit flow run(s)**.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The number of flows that you can resubmit is limited based on the maximum number of API calls for the connectors in the flow.

## Cancel flow runs

You can cancel flow runs either through the Run history page or by using a template. If you need to cancel up to 20 runs, use the Run history page. If you need to cancel more than 20 (even hundreds), use the template. Procedures for both methods are detailed in the following sections.

### Cancel up to 20 flow runs

To cancel flow runs that are in progress, follow the steps outlined previously in [Resubmit flow runs](#resubmit-flow-runs) with one exception: In step 6, select **Cancel flow run(s)**, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="./media/cancel-resubmit-how-to/cancel-runs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that displays the Cancel flow run(s) button.":::

### Cancel more than 20 flow runs

The template cancels runs at approximately five (5) runs per minute. You might be subject to throttling if you change the delay period in the template flow.

> [!NOTE]
> - You can use the template only of you have a license that includes premium connectors. To learn more, go to [Types of Power Automate licenses&mdash;Premium connectors.](/power-platform/admin/power-automate-licensing/types#premium-connectors)
> - This template isn't available for sovereign cloud customers.

Follow these steps to cancel flow runs using a template:

1. Obtain the **Environment Id** and **Flow Id**.
    1. To find the Environment Id, select **Home** in the left navigation pane and look at the URL in your browser's address bar. Everything between `environments/` and `/home` is the Environment Id:

        :::image type="content" source="media/cancel-resubmit-how-to/find-environment-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a flow URL with the Environment Id highlighted.":::

        If you can't locate the Environment ID, ask your administrator to go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home) Details section. To learn more, go to [Find your environment and organization ID](/power-platform/admin/determine-org-id-name#find-your-environment-and-organization-id).

    1. To find the Flow Id, select **My flows** in the left navigation pane and select your flow. When the Details page opens, look at the URL in your browser's address bar. Everything between `flows/` and `/details` is the Flow Id:
        :::image type="content" source="media/cancel-resubmit-how-to/find-flow-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a flow URL with the Flow Id highlighted.":::

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
