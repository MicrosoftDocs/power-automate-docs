1. On the left panel, select **My flows**.
1. On the right panel, select the cloud flow that you would like to resubmit or cancel.
1. Select **All runs**.

   >[!TIP]
   >The flow must have runs to cancel or resubmit the flow runs.

1. Select the flow runs that you would like to resubmit or cancel on the **Run history** page.
