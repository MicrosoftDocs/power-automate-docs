Using event log files from your ERP systems like Dynamics 365 or SAP, process advisor will produce a process map. This map enables you to visualizes the activities in the procure to pay process to derive the following insights:

- Which activities in a process take the longest?

- How many variations of invoice approval exist in the organization?

- Are the activities of the process within compliance?

You can easily filter for custom attributes such as location, department, and other dimensions that are relevant to your process.
