## Business example

For example, as a business owner in accounts payable, you can use process advisor to find the steps and actions in your procure-to-pay process. Using event log files from your ERP systems like Dynamics 365 or SAP, process advisor produces a process map. This map enables you to visualize the activities in the procure-to-pay process to gain the following insights:

- Which activities in a process take the longest?

- How many variations of invoice approval exist in the organization?

- Are the activities of the process within compliance?

You can easily filter for custom attributes such as location, department, and other dimensions that are relevant to your process.
