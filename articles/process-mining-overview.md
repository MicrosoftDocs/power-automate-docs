## Business example

As a business owner in accounts payable, you can use process advisor to find the steps and actions in your procure to pay process. Using event log files from your ERP systems like Dynamics 365 or SAP, process advisor will produce a process map. This map enables you to visualizes the activities in the procure to pay process to derive the following insights:

- Which activities in a process take the longest?

- Are the activities of the process within compliance?

You can easily filter for custom attributes such as location, department, and other dimensions that are relevant to your process.
