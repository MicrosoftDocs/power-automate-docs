# Overview of process mining (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](./includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Process mining in process advisor allows you to take the event data from your system of records and visualize the processes happening in your organization. Process mining provides novel insights that can help you identify automation opportunities, and address performance and compliance opportunities.

## Business example

For example, as a business owner in accounts payable, you can use process advisor to find the steps and actions in your procure-to-pay process. Using event log files from your ERP systems like Dynamics 365 or SAP, process advisor produces a process map. This map enables you to visualize the activities in the procure-to-pay process to gain the following insights:

- Which activities in a process take the longest?

- How many variations of invoice approval exist in the organization?

- Are the activities of the process within compliance?

You can easily filter for custom attributes such as location, department, and other dimensions that are relevant to your process.
