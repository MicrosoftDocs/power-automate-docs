1. Enter **new row** into the **Search connectors and actions** search box on the **Choose an operation** card.
1. Select **Microsoft Dataverse**.
1. Select **Add a new row** action.

   After you select a table, the card expands, displaying both optional and required items. All mandatory items display an asterisk (\*).

>[!TIP]
>You can use outputs from previous triggers and actions in the **Dynamic content** selector, as shown in the following image, or modify them by building an expression as outlined in [Use expressions in flow actions](https://make.powerautomate.com/blog/use-expressions-in-actions/).<!-- Edit note: Try to avoid use of en-us. -->
