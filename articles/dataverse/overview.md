# Overview of how to integrate Power Automate flows with Dataverse

With [Microsoft Dataverse](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/dataverse/?ef_id=4425b9cfc5191d82cc2ed9a8b6fe9233:G:s&OCID=AID2100430_SEM_4425b9cfc5191d82cc2ed9a8b6fe9233:G:s&msclkid=4425b9cfc5191d82cc2ed9a8b6fe9233), you can store and manage data for business applications and integrate natively with other Microsoft Power Platform services like Power Apps, Power Pages, and Microsoft Copilot Studio from your [cloud flows](../overview-cloud.md).

The Microsoft Dataverse connector provides [several triggers](#overview-of-triggers) to start your flows and [many actions](#overview-of-actions) that you can use to create or update data in Dataverse while your flows run. You can use Dataverse actions even if your flows don't use a trigger from the Dataverse connector.

Use the Microsoft Dataverse connector to create cloud flows that start when data changes in Dataverse tables and custom messages. <!--todo, how is custom messages-->For example, you can send an email whenever a row gets updated in Dataverse.
