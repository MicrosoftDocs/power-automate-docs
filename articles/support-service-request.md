You'll learn the differences between examples of problems with individual flows and how they differ with the problems related to the Power Automate product and relevant services. You'll also learn about what additional information you can provide to help expedite the problem investigation, narrow down the scope of the problem through clear steps to reproduce the issue that helps support team reach a resolution faster.

## Provide screenshots or videos

For user interface issues, screenshots or videos can more quickly clarify the steps to reproduce the bug, rather than a written description.

## Link to the official documentation

Include links to Microsoft Learn documentation to clarify the affected feature and its expected behavior.

For issues with professional development features, provide a link to the documentation for the API function that doesn't work.

## Simplify code samples

If the issue involves coding and other professional development features, simplify the code first. Verify the issue occurs and attach a snippet of the problematic code.

## Provide system info


## Add notes from your investigation

You might try different configurations to eliminate possible causes. Mention these configurations in the support request. This inclusion helps others understand the issue better and avoid repeating the same steps.
