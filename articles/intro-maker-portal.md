# Understand the Power Automate interface

Power Automate interface allows you to quickly and easily create cloud flows and use templates to solve your business needs, such as:

- Start creating a flow directly on the Power Automate **Home** page and **Create** page.
- Receive guided instruction for building your flow.
- Find a template that addresses your needs by filtering through selections.
- Automate your flows with new options in the **New flow** dropdown menu.

> [!NOTE]
> The experience described in this article is now generally available. We will update the Power Automate documentation to reflect the new experience soon.

## Create a flow

You can start creating a flow as soon as you sign in to Power Automate by selecting **Create** at the top of the **Home** page.

You can then choose your path for creating a flow. Your two choices are to start with a template to find prebuilt flows, or build your own custom automation.

If you want even more ways to automate, select **Create** on the menu to the left. You'll see the same two options at the top of the screen and some additional options at the bottom. The following selections allow you to automate repetitive desktop processes, add intelligence to automation, analyze and optimize business processes, and describe and build using your own words.

- **Power Automate for desktop**: Drag-and-drop or record the steps of a task to automate your process.

- **AI Builder**: Accelerate digital transformation for complex scenarios with artificial intelligence.

- **Process advisor**: Record and analyze processes to discover inefficiencies and make improvements.

- **You describe it, AI builds it**: Transform your everyday words into a cloud flow (preview).

## Start with a template

Power Automate makes intelligent choices to find the prebuilt templates that align best with your needs. It does this by filtering out the templates that won't work for you, leaving you with only the templates that might meet your business goals.

When you select **Start with a template**, the **Find a template** screen displays. This screen allows you to set filters to show as many templates as you want, and search for templates using keywords.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-experience-preview/filter-by.png" alt-text="Screenshot of choosing filters and using keywords.":::

For example, if you select **Microsoft Dataverse** in the **Filter by** group, you'll get a list of many templates to choose from. If you're looking for Dataverse templates that include email, you can type **email** in the **Search by keywords** list.

You can also filter by connector name, template category, and publisher name. To customize your filter with these options, select **More filters** on the **Find a template** screen.

To learn more, go to [Create a cloud flow from a template](get-started-logic-template.md).

## Build your own

If you select **Build your own**, Power Automate will guide you in selecting your triggers, actions, and connectors.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-experience-preview/connectors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of building your flow with triggers, actions, and connectors.":::

To learn how to build your own flow, go to [Create a cloud flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md). To learn about triggers, go to [Get started with triggers](triggers-introduction.md). For an overview of connectors, go to [Connectors overview](/connectors/connectors).

## Flow menu options

If you're already working in the **My flows** screen, you can stay where you are and create a new template from the **New flows** menu. You can start with a template, or build your own automation with the same interface used on the home screen. The menu also gives you the option to create a desktop flow, or a flow that uses a description of what you want to automate in everyday language.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-experience-preview/my-flows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options in the New flow menu in the My flows screen.":::

To learn about desktop flows, go to [Introduction to desktop flows](desktop-flows/introduction.md). To learn how to use AI to build your flow, go to [Create a cloud flow from a description (preview)](create-cloud-flow-from-description.md).
