#customer intent: As a business process analyst, I want to learn how to create a datetime hiararchy for datetime columns in the Power Automate Process Mining semantic model in Fabric workspace.

# Introduction

In Fabric export, data is stored in Lakehouse tables, with a semantic model built on top. This document explains how to enable datetime hierarchies for multiple datetime columns in the semantic model, allowing for detailed visuals grouped by time periods such as year or month.

# Create datetime hierarchy for a datetime column

To enable a datetime hierarchy for a datetime column, a custom semantic model can be created based on the semantic model generated by Power Automate Process Mining in the Fabric workspace. New columns or tables should be added to this custom semantic model, which will then be used to create reports. The steps outlined below should be followed to enable datetime hierarchies for the relevant datetime columns. 

> [!NOTE]
> - This approach enables the hierarchy for one datetime column at a time; the process must be repeated for each column requiring a datetime hierarchy.

## Create a Custom Model on Top of the Semantic Model

1. Navigate to the report created in the Fabric workspace, download and open it using the Power BI Desktop.

2. In Power BI Desktop, create a local model from this semantic model. Under the *Modelling* tab, select *Make changes to this model* and in the dialog select *Add a local model*.

3. If the following error pops up:

   Reconnect the data source by clicking *Transform Data*/*Data source settings* and selecting your semantic model from the list (usually it is the first one) and retry the previous step.

## Create Derived Date column for the Datetime column

Datetime hierarchies only work with the date portion of a column, not time values. To use the hierarchy, create a separate date-only column in the same table as the original datetime column. 

> [!NOTE]
> - Ignore this step if the column contains only date and not time portion.

1. Navigate to the table containing the original datetime column and click *New column* from the table context menu
2. To create the column use the following DAX query and replace the placeholders with specific column names

```
<DateColumnName> = DATE(YEAR(<OriginalColumnName>), MONTH(<OriginalColumnName>), DAY(<OriginalColumnName>))
```

For example:
