# Using environments within Power Automate

An *environment* is a space to store, manage, and share your organization's business data, apps, and flows. It also serves as a container to separate apps that might have different roles, security requirements, or target audiences. How you choose to use environments depends on your organization and the apps you build. For example:

- You can choose to only build your apps in a single environment.
You might create separate environments that group the test and production versions of your apps.

- You might create separate environments that correspond to specific teams or departments in your company, each containing the relevant data and apps for each audience.

- You might also create separate environments for different global branches of your company.

You can create and manage environments using the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac). 

Learn all about [environments](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) in the Microsoft Power Platform admin guide.
