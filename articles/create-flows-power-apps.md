# Create and manage flows in Power Apps

Your Power Automate license also gives you rights to create and manage flows in Power Apps. Here are the ways you can do this in Power Apps.

- Through [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). After you sign in to Power Apps, select **Flows** in the left navigation pane.
- Through [Power Automate pane](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-flows) within Power Apps Studio.

Check out the Power Automate [Get started guide](getting-started.md) to create your first flow.
