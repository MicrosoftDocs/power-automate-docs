# Filter by Variant

:::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-studio/variant-filter-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the variant filter settings panel.":::

The variant filter allows you to select specific variants to include in your view or analysis.

## Selection Counter

The title displays "Filter by variant" followed by a counter in parentheses showing the number of currently selected variants. For example, "(0)" indicates no variants are selected, while "(5)" would indicate five variants are selected.

## Search Functionality

Use the search bar at the top of the filter dialog to quickly find specific variants by name. This is particularly useful when working with a large number of variants. Type in the search box to filter the list and locate the desired variant.

## Select All / Clear All

Two quick action buttons are available above the variant list:

- **Select all**: Checks all variants in the list, selecting them for filtering
- **Clear all**: Unchecks all variants, removing all selections

> [!NOTE]
> Select all is available only on a list with a maximum of 100 values. If the list is longer, use the search functionality to limit the list of values.

## Checkbox Selection

Each variant in the scrollable list has an individual checkbox. Click the checkbox next to any variant name to select or deselect it. Multiple variants can be selected simultaneously by checking multiple checkboxes.

## Apply and Cancel

Once you've made your selections:

- **Apply**: Confirms your variant selections and applies the filter
- **Cancel**: Closes the dialog without applying any changes to your variant filter

Changes only take effect when you click Apply.
