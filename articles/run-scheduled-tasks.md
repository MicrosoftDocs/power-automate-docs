# Run flows on a schedule

Create a cloud flow that performs one or more tasks (such as sending a report in email).

* Once a day, an hour, or a minute.
* On a date that you specify.
* After a number days, hours, or minutes that you specify.

## Create a recurring flow

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
1. Select **My flows** > **New flow** > **Scheduled cloud flow**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of create a scheduled cloud flow.](./media/run-scheduled-tasks/create-flow.png "Create a scheduled cloud flow")

1. In the fields next to **Starting**, specify the date and time when your flow should start.
1. In the fields next to **Repeat every**, specify the flow's recurrence.
1. Select **Create**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Set recurrence.](./media/run-scheduled-tasks/select-recurrence.png "Set recurrence")

## Configure advanced options

1. Follow the steps in the previous section.
1. Select **Recurrence** > **Show advanced options**. When you select **Show advanced options**, the dropdown name changes to **Hide advanced options**.

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of show/hide advanced options.](./media/run-scheduled-tasks/select-recurrence1.png "Show/hide advanced options")

    >[!NOTE]
    >These options change based on the values to which **Interval** and **Frequency** are set. If your screen doesn't match the graphic below, make sure that **Interval** and **Frequency** are set to the same values that the graphic shows.

1. In the **Time zone** field, select a time zone from the dropdown list to specify whether the **Start time** reflects a local time zone, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), or other time zone.
1. In the **Start time** field, enter a start time in this format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
1. If you specified **Day** under **Frequency**, select the time of day when the flow should run in the **At these hours** and **At these minutes** dropdown lists.
1. If you specified **Week** under **Frequency**, do the following.<br/>
    - In the **On these days** and **At these hours** dropdown lists, select the day or days of the week on which the flow should run and the time or times of day when the flow should run.
    - In the **At these minutes** field, enter the minute values (from 0 to 59) separated by a comma.

    For example, configure the options as shown to start a cloud flow no sooner than 3:00 PM (Pacific time) on Thursday, March 24, 2022, and run it every two weeks on Tuesdays at 5:30 PM (Pacific time).

    >[!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![Screenshot of specified advanced options.](./media/run-scheduled-tasks/advanced-options.png "Specify advanced options")

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you run a flow on the month frequency, the flow runs on the same date each month.

1. Add the action or actions that you want the flow to take, as described in [Create a cloud flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md).
