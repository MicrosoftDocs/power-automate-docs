# Use flows with Excel

Integrate Power Automate with Excel for the web and desktop to automate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and improve productivity. For example, you can track customer feedback, manage projects, or analyze data. By connecting Excel to apps and services such as SharePoint, Teams, and Planner, Power Automate can make collaboration and data sharing across different platforms seem effortless.

With this feature, you can easily create Power Automate workflows in Excel. To get started, select a Power Automate prebuilt template that closely meets your needs. Then, customize it to fit your Excel workbook.

Here are some of the prebuilt templates that you can use in Excel:

- Monitor incoming emails to an alias in an Excel worksheet
- Track Planner tasks in Excel
- Categorize Excel rows with GPT

## Build a flow in Excel

1. Select **Create flow**.

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Manage your flow

After you create a flow, you can manage it from Excel. Management includes the ability to delete your flow, turn it off, edit it, and view details about it.

To manage your flow, select the ellipsis (**&hellip;**) for it in the **Power Automate** pane, and then select an option on the menu.

- If your flow uses the Excel Online (Business) connector, you might experience issues. Learn about the issues and limitations in [Excel Online (Business)](/connectors/excelonlinebusiness#general-known-issues-and-limitations).
