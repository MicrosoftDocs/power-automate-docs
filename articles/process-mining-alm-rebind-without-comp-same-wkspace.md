# Rebind reports without using a composite model (same workspace)

If you linked your process in your Test environment to a workspace (for example, WkSpace A) that's the same as the one used for the process in your Dev environment (for example, WkSpace A), follow the steps in this article.

## Attach a workspace to your process

[!INCLUDE[alm-attach-workspace](./includes/alm-attach-workspace.md)]

4. If you newly imported the process, continue to step 5. If you didn't newly import the process, go to step 6.

1. Select the *same workspace* for this process by following these steps:
    1. In the **Power BI workspace** dropdown menu, select the *same workspace* as the previous workspace.
    1. In the **Report Name** field, enter a *different* report name from your previous report name.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The report name must be different from your previous report name.

    1. To continue setting up the process, select **Continue**.

1. (If you didn't newly import the process) Attach a custom Power BI workspace to the process:
    1. Go to the process details page for the process.
    1. On the **Details** card, select **Edit**.
    1. From the **Power BI workspace (optional)** dropdown menu, select your **WkSpace A** Power BI workspace that you want to migrate customizations to.
    1. Provide a *different* report name from the name you used for the process in Dev environment.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        >
        > The report name must be different from the report name of the process in Dev environment.

    1. Select **Save** > **Continue**.
    1. From the command bar or in the report view, select **Refresh data**.

## Rebind the Power BI report

1. Sign in to [Power BI](https://msit.powerbi.com/home).
1. From the left navigation pane, select **Workspaces** > your **WkSpace A**.
1. In your **WkSpace A**, open your **Report A**.
1. From the command bar, download the report by selecting **File** >**Download this file** > **"A copy of your report with a live connection"** > **Download**.
1. Open the downloaded report in Power BI for desktop.
1. From the **File** menu, select **Save as**.
1. Enter the *same name* for the report as your Report B, and then select **Save**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure you to do this step to ensure that this report overwrites Report B when you publish.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/save-as-same.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to overwrite a report.":::

1. From the command bar in the **Home** tab, select **Transform data** > **Data source settings**.
1. From the list of semantic models, select the semantic model of the process that's in the Test environment and whose report is in your **WkSpace A**, and then select **Connect**.

    Since you're using the same workspace for both your processes in Dev and Test, the location of the semantic model you select is your **WkSpace A**. This is called *rebinding*.

    :::image type="content" source="media/process-mining-alm-rebind-without-comp/semantic-same.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new report in your WkSpace A location.":::

    The report refreshes. Learn more about semantic models in [Semantic models in the Power BI service](/power-bi/connect-data/service-datasets-understand).

1. From the command bar, save the report by selecting **Save**.
1. From the command bar, publish the report by selecting **Publish**.
1. From the list of destinations, select your **WkSpace A** > **Select**.

    A message that says **Replacing report** opens, indicating you gave the report the same name as your old Report B.

1. To overwrite the old report in WkSpace A, select **Replace**.

1. When this process completes, return to Power BI and open **WkSpace A**.

    The customizations from Report A are now successfully transferred to Report B in the same **WkSpace A**.
