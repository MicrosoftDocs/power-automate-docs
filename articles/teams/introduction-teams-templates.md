# Use flows in teams created from templates

Microsoft Teams templates are prebuilt definitions of a team's structure that are designed around a specific business need or project.

Power Automate templates and team templates are meant to address similar business scenarios. When you create a team with a Microsoft-provided team template, you get a curated selection of flow templates that are specific to your team scenario.

Here are the five team templates that support scenario-specific flow templates.

- Manage a Project
- Manage an Event
- Organize a Help Desk
- Incident Response
- Onboard Employees

For example, if you create a team from the **Manage a Project** template, the recommended flow templates on the Power Automate tab in the General channel is filtered to your Manage a Project scenario.

For example, follow these steps to use the **Manage a Project** template from within Microsoft Teams.

1. Open Microsoft Teams.
1. Select **Teams** from the top of the panel on the left.
1. Select **Join or create a team** from the bottom of the **Teams** panel on the left.
1. Select **Create team** from the **Join or create a team** screen.
