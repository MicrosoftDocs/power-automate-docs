# Manage flows in Microsoft Teams

The **Home** tab provides an overview of your flows from your organization's default environment.

By default, the **Home** tab is filtered to display flows that use Microsoft Teams triggers and actions. You can select **Microsoft Teams flows** to change the filter to display all your flows.

On the **Home** tab, you can view the information that's displayed in each of the following six columns to get an overview of your flows.

Column | Description
----|----
 Flow name | Represents the name that you provided for the flow.
