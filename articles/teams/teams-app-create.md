# Create flows in Microsoft Teams

There are multiple ways in which you can create flows within Microsoft Teams.

- Power Automate flow templates - The Microsoft Teams store has templates directly integrated, making it easy for you to get flow templates to get started quickly.
- Team overflow messages - You can also create flows from the overflow menu of Teams message.
- Power Automate app - You can also use the [Power Automate app](./install-teams-app.md) to create flows from a template or from scratch.

You can manage all flows you create from any of these entry points directly within Power Automate or from within the [Power Automate app](./install-teams-app.md) in Teams.

## Prerequisites

To use the Power Automate app, you need an account with access to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you create flows from within the Power Automate app in Microsoft Teams, they are always created in your organization's default environment. You can also access these flows from [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).

## Create a cloud flow from scratch

If you want full control over the flow that you create, select **Create from blank** from the top right side of the screen, instead of using a template.

## Known issues

- All flows that you create from within the Power Automate app are located in your organization's default environment.

- The Power Automate app and Power Automate Actions app must be  enabled in the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) in order for this functionality to work.
