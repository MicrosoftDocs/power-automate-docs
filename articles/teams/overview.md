# Use flows in Microsoft Teams

Power Automate flows can be used in three scenarios with Teams.

Scenario|Description
--------|-------
Trigger [flows from Teams messages](../trigger-flow-teams-message.md).| In this scenario, you can create flows that are triggered when someone selects a Teams message. The flow can then run as any other flow you create.
Use flows with [adaptive cards](../create-adaptive-cards.md).| Here, adaptive cards can be used as the trigger for flows. The full set of rich adaptive cards is available to you.
Create flows from within the [Power Apps app in Teams](./create-flows-power-apps-app.md).|Use the Power Apps app in Teams to create flows that use [Project Oakdale](/powerapps/teams/overview). Project Oakdale is a built-in, low-code data platform for Teams that empowers users to build custom apps and workflows within Teams by using Power Apps and Power Automate.
