# Customizing approvals in Teams

By default, the approvals app only lets you modify custom responses in the app. 

If you want to create a custom process with pre and post approval actions that are automatically triggered using an event, you will need to create an approval flow in the Power Automate.

[Visit the approvals documentation section to get started with approval flows](../get-started-approvals.md)
