# Enable self-service disaster recovery

When you enable a self-service disaster recovery (SSDR) cross-region failover approach, you ensure that your workloads continue to run during an unexpected region-wide issue.

If you want to use SSDR for Power Automate on an existing environment, you must open a support ticket/ICM before turning on the feature in Power Platform admin center to prepare your environment for disaster recovery. The process for preparing the environment could take multiple weeks.

For a newly created environment, opening a ticket isn't required. You can enable disaster recovery at any time.

## Create a self-service disaster recovery (SSDR)

To create an SSDR plan, you need to define and execute a failover approach. We recommend that you also conduct disaster recovery drills as an essential step in your plan.
