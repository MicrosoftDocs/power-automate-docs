# Enable self-service disaster recovery

If you want to use Self service disaster recovery (SSDR) for Power Automate on an existing environment, you must open a support ticket/ICM before turning on the feature in Power Platform admin center to prepare your environment for disaster recovery. The process of preparing the environment could take a while. There's no SLA for completion of this process; times can vary depending on the resource demands within a region and other factors. Once the ICM is resolved, you may follow normal SSDR steps.

For a newly created environment, opening a ticket isn't required. You can enable disaster recovery at any time.

## Restrictions
Like with CMK, with SSDR certain flows will not be protected by SSDR. You may follow the same instructions to protect them for SSDR.
