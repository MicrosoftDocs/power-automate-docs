# Respond to GDPR Data Subject Delete Requests


The **right to erasure** by the removal of personal data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes removing all personal data except audit log information.

Power Automate allows users to build automated workflows. When a user decides to delete their personal data from Power Automate, the user can review their personal data, and determine whether to delete some or all of it.

The following table shows which personal data is automatically deleted and which data requires a Microsoft Account (MSA) user to review and delete it.

|Requires the MSA user to review and delete|Automatically deleted|
|------|------|
|Product and service activity|Run history|
|Flows|Activity Feed|
|Connections||

Power Automate offers the following experiences to help users find, review, or change personal data and resources that aren't automatically deleted:
