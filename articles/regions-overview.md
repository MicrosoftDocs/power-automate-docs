# Power Automate regions overview

In Power Automate, your flows are created within your Microsoft Power Platform environment. These environments are specific to a region, which corresponds to the location of the data centers where your Microsoft Power Platform environment is stored.

In other words, your flows are deployed in the [data center region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) that hosts your Microsoft [Power Platform environment](environments-overview-admin.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### What region should I use?

It's a good idea to create your flow in an environment that's in the region closest to your customers. When the data centers that host your environment are closer to the people accessing the information, you're likely to see better performance.

### How can I find out the region where my flow is deployed?

Administrators can identify the region by signing in to the Power Platform [admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). The **Environments** tab lists all existing environments and their regions.

### Is Power Automate available in national clouds?

Yes. [Learn more](./us-govt.md).

### What outbound IP addresses are used in each region?

Learn about outbound IP addresses in each region in [Power Automate IP address configuration](/power-automate/ip-address-configuration).

### Can region be changed?

A [support case](/power-platform/admin/get-help-support) is needed to change environment region.
