## Export a user's approval history

1. On the web or desktop, open [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com).
1. In Teams, follow one of these steps to open the **Approvals** app:

    - From the main search bar, search for **Approvals**. 
    - In the left pane, select the ellipsis (**&hellip;**), and then search for or select **Approvals**.

1. On the **Received** tab, select **Export** in the upper-right corner to export received approvals.
1. Select the export dates, and then select **Export**.
1. On the **Sent** tab, select **Export** in the upper-right corner to export sent approvals.
1. Select the export dates, and then select **Export**.

Repeat the previous procedure for every environment that the user is part. Use the environment switcher in the upper right of the **Approvals** app page to  switch environments.

Alternatively, open [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Approvals** on the left navigation pane, and select the **History** tab. You can then manually copy approval contents for received and sent approvals. To ensure that you get the contents for both types of approvals, select the appropriate filter (**Received** or **Sent**) in the upper-right corner.
