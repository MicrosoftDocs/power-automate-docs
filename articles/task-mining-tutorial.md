### Explore the features

You'll see the following features:

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/features.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the toolbar features.":::

- **New recording**: Create a new recording.

- **Analytics**: See the process map and insights.

- **Share**: Share your processes with your team members.

    Process owners can pick two role options when sharing with other users: contributor and co-owner. The contributor role gives the user the ability to upload their own recording to the process. The co-owner role gives the user the ability to upload recordings and edit other recordings.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/roles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of role options.":::

- **Analyze**: Analyze a process.

- **Create activity names**: Create activity names for your process.

- **Delete process**: Delete your process.

## Analyze a process

1. Select **Analyze** to analyze a process. When you perform this action, process advisor will analyze existing recordings to identify any bottlenecks within the business process.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/analyzing-recs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analyze button.":::

1. The analysis will take a few minutes to complete. During this process, a status message displays under the **New recording** button. If you run into an error during the analysis stage, select **Analyze** to trigger this action again.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/analyzing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the process analysis status screen.":::

1. Once it's done, you'll see the **Process analysis status**  change to **Analyzed**. Select **Analytics** to see the process map and insights. This step may take a couple minutes to complete after the analysis has been performed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/analytics-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analytics button.":::

### Analytics page layout

This section explains what you can do on the **Analytics** screen.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/analytics-layout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analytics screen":::

- **Automate activities (preview)**: If during the recording process, a user ran an application that has its Power Automate actions (for example, Microsoft Outlook or Excel), then after selecting **Automate activities (preview)**, a draft Power Automate process would be opened containing the actions related to the used applications that can be automated. The user would then be able to start building the final process using the proposed draft.

- **Legend**: Displays information about the report to let users better understand what they see.

- **Process**: Provides detailed information about the analyzed process. This is where users can find the process map and general information about the process (time analytics per variant and per the recording’s author).

- **Application**: Provides information about the apps used in recordings. This includes what apps were used by authors, how often were they used, and what the transitions were between them. This report explains which connectors should be used when implementing automation for the process, and where potentially to use desktop flows as there’s no existing connector.

### Business process step relationships

In the previous example, you'll see the various steps in the business process and their related durations. These steps include:

- **Download invoice attachment from email (48 seconds)**

- **Open Excel invoice list (11.5 seconds)**

- **Open invoice from OneDrive (21 seconds)**

- **Enter invoice details (53.6 seconds)**

- **Save and submit (9 seconds)**

- **Notify team of submission (26.67 seconds)**

## Gather insights with a process map

The process map makes it possible to visualize and analyze processes. By looking at a graphical representation of how your business processes are performed, you can gather insights about where improvement opportunities exist.

Go to the process map by selecting **Analytics** > **Process map**.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/gather-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the process map.":::

## View metrics with activity combinations and variants

This section explains the **Variants by frequency** bars on the right.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/variant.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the variants by time in seconds bars.":::

Different activity combinations and variants are shown separately on the process map. A process variant is a unique path from the beginning to the end of the process. A process variant is a specific activity sequence, like a 'trace' through the process, from start to end. Each variant differs from the others by at least one activity. You can see additional metrics, frequency of the activities, and throughput time on the process map. Frequency shows you the total number of recordings/cases passing through it. Throughput time is the time between the first event of the case and the last.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/var-by-frequency.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Variants by frequency' tab.":::

If you select the first variant by selecting the first bar, you can see that the invoice coming through email is the most frequent process variant. It might take a while for you to see the changes from the chart. 

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/variant-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the invoice coming from email variant in the process map.":::

## Identify automation opportunities

You can see that people spend a lot of their time entering the information in the application. This helps identify an opportunity to automate the process.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/invoice-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering invoice details.":::

### View analytics data

1. Deselect **Var 1** by selecting any blank space within the **Variant by frequency** area.

:::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/variant-blank.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a blank space.":::
  
1. Look at the top analytics data. The average process time is 1.47 minutes out of five recordings.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/analytics-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of analytics data.":::

1. Analyze other time-based metrics dashboards.

   - **Activity by average time in sec**: Notice that **Enter invoice details** and **Download invoice** are taking the most time.

        :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/avg-time-sec.png" alt-text="Screenshot of activity by average time in seconds.":::

    - **Recording by average time in min**: Notice that some people (**Preston Morales** and **Shakti Menon**) are taking more time than others.

        :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/avg-time-min.png" alt-text="Screenshot of media/task-mining-tutorial/avg-time-min.png":::

1. Select the **Application (preview)** tab to see details on which applications were used.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/app-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Application (preview)":::

    It might take a while to load the reports.

    - This report is important, as it allows you to discover insights into the different applications used in a business process, the frequency with which they're accessed, and how much time is spent on the application.

    - For example, the dashboard shows that a legacy invoicing app, Outlook, and Excel have significant contributions to time spent and actions by applications.*

    - Take time to get familiar with the different reports.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/app-preview-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Application (preview) screen.":::

1. Go back to the process map by selecting **Process**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/process-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Process tab.":::

1. Look at the automate activities feature. From the process map, you can see that process advisor has highlighted several activities as potential candidates for automation based on applications.

1. Start creating a flow for automation by selecting **Automate activities (preview)** at the top.

     :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/blue-circles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of process map with blue circles.":::

    A tab will open in the browser and show the flow designer. The recommended actions that match to the activities from the process map automatically appear on the right panel. For example, several email connectors are suggested for you to use in order to automate the **Download invoice attachment from email** activity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/task-mining-tutorial/connectors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of recommended email connectors.":::
