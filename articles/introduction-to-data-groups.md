# Learn all about data groups

## What is a data group?

Data groups are a simple way to categorize services within a [data loss prevention (DLP) policy](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention). The two data groups available are the **Business data only** group and the **No business data allowed** group. Organizations are free to determine which services are placed into a particular data group. A good way to categorize services is to place them in groups, based on the impact to the organization. By default, all services are placed into the **No business data allowed** data group. You manage the services in a data group when you create or modify the properties of a DLP policy from the admin center.

Visit the Microsoft Power Platform documentation to learn more about [data groups and data loss prevention policies](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention).
