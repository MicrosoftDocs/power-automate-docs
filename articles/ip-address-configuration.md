# IP address configuration for Power Automate

This article describes the required configuration for Power Automate to connect to services in your network. It explains the configuration required for your makers and users to access Power Automate to build and use experiences.

## Allow flows to call your services

The following two sections list the network configuration required for Power Automate to connect to services in your network. This configuration is needed only if you're restricting inbound or outbound IP addresses on your network (for example, through a firewall).

### Allow connector calls to your services

Power Automate flows are comprised of actions. Actions can utilize both *connector actions* and native actions such as 'HTTP' and 'HTTP + Swagger'. To enable *connector actions* to call services hosted in your network, allow traffic into your network from the **AzureConnectors** service tag.

### Allowlist 'HTTP' and 'HTTP + Swagger' calls to your services

For flows consisting of actions including 'HTTP' and 'HTTP + Swagger', add the network configuration to allow *all* of the following items:

- **LogicApps** service tag
- **PowerPlatformPlex** service tag
- [IP range for 'HTTP' or 'HTTP + Swagger'](#ip-range-for-http-actions-and-http--swagger)

## Allow users on your network to use the Power Automate

This section contains information on providing your makers and users access to the build and use experiences within Power Automate.

### Use the Power Automate web portal

The Power Automate web portal is also known as the maker portal.

The following table lists the services to which Power Automate connects. Ensure none of these services is blocked on your network.

## Other IP address articles

### Approval email delivery

Learn more about approvals email routing in [Power Automate approval email delivery information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128304).

### Azure SQL database

If you need to authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, use the [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

## FAQ

### There are lots of details here&mdash;what's the high level recommendation for IP address configuration?

The simplest mechanism to configure a firewall to allow Power Automate cloud flows to call external services through [connectors](/connectors/overview) is to use [Azure service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). The primary service tag for Logic Apps connectors is **AzureConnectors**, as described in [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

### If I'm using Azure firewall, do I need to keep track of individual IP addresses?

You should use [Azure service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). By using service tags in your network security group rules, you don't need to constantly monitor and manually update IP ranges for each service.

### If I'm using on-premises firewall, do I need to keep track of individual IP addresses?

You should use the [Service Tags with an on-premises firewall](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#service-tags-on-premises) so you don't need to monitor and manually update IP ranges. The [Service Tag Discovery API](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#use-the-service-tag-discovery-api) provides access to the latest IP address ranges associated with each service tag, enabling you to stay current with changes.

## IP range for 'HTTP' actions and 'HTTP + Swagger'

For the HTTP connector actions 'HTTP' and 'HTTP + Swagger', allowlist the **PowerPlatformPlex** service tag and the following IP ranges:
