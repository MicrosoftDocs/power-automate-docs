# IP address configuration

The [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform) from which Power Automate requests are sent depend on the [region](regions-overview.md) where the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow is located. We don't currently publish FQDNs available for flow scenarios.

Some calls a cloud flow makes may come from IP addresses that are listed in the [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags) documentation. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI.

You should also consult the [Limits and Configuration](limits-and-config.md) article for a supplemental listing for known IP addresses that Power Automate uses.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're restricting inbound or outbound IP addresses on your network (for example, through a firewall), to ensure flows continue to work, update your network configuration to allow both the [IP addresses for Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-ip-configuration) and the [IP addresses for managed connectors](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses) in the supported regions. To learn more, go to [Azure Logic Apps - Set up zone redundancy with availability zones](/azure/logic-apps/set-up-zone-redundancy-availability-zones).

## Logic Apps

Calls made from a cloud flow go directly through the Azure Logic Apps service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + Open API. To learn which IP addresses are used by that service, go to the [Logic Apps documentation](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags).

## Connectors

Calls made from a connector in a cloud flow (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from these [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

If you must authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, you should use these addresses.

## Required services

The following table lists the services to which Power Automate connects. Ensure none of these services is blocked on your network.

## Desktop flows services required for runtime

The following table lists endpoint data requirements for connectivity from a user's machine for desktop flows runs. You need to ensure that you authorize Global endpoints and the endpoints corresponding to your cloud.
