# IP address configuration
The [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform) from which Power Automate requests are sent depends on the [region](regions-overview.md) where the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow is located. We don't currently publish FQDNs available for flow scenarios.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Some calls a cloud flow makes may come from IP addresses that are listed in the [Logic apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags) documentation. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI.

You should also consult the [Limits and Configuration](limits-and-config.md) article for a supplemental listing for known IP addresses that Power Automate uses.

## Logic Apps
Calls made from a cloud flow go directly through the Azure Logic App service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + Open API. Please reference [the Logic apps documentation](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags) for which IP addresses are used by that service.

## Connectors
Calls made from a connector in a cloud flow (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from these [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).


If you must authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, you should use these addresses.
