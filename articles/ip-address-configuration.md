# IP address configuration

The [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform) from which Power Automate requests are sent depend on the [region](regions-overview.md) location of the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow. FQDNs (fully qualified domain names) aren't published for flow scenarios.

The simplest mechanism to configure a firewall to allow Power Automate cloud flows to call external services through [connectors](/connectors/overview) is to use [Azure service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). The primary service tag for Logic Apps connectors is **AzureConnectors**, as described in [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

## Logic Apps and connectors for cloud flows runtime

Calls made from a cloud flow go directly through the Azure Logic Apps service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI.

Learn which IP addresses are used by that service in [Azure Logic Apps documentation](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags).

If you're restricting inbound or outbound IP addresses on your network (for example, through a firewall), to ensure flows continue to work, update your network configuration to allow both the [IP addresses for Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-ip-configuration) and the [IP addresses for managed connectors](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses) in the supported regions. Learn more in [Azure Logic Apps - Set up zone redundancy with availability zones](/azure/logic-apps/set-up-zone-redundancy-availability-zones). In order to automate the process of firewall or configuration updates, you can leverage the Azure IP range downloadable JSON file in the Download Center: [Downloadable IP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519)

If you need to authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, you should use the [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

## FAQ

### There are lots of details here&mdash;what's the high level recommendation for IP Address configuration?

The simplest mechanism to configure a firewall to allow Power Automate cloud flows to call external services through [connectors](/connectors/overview) is to use [Azure service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). The primary service tag for Logic Apps connectors is **AzureConnectors**, as described in [Power Platform outbound IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

### If I'm using Azure Firewall, do I need to keep track of individual IP addresses?

You should use [Azure service tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview). By using service tags in your network security group rules, you don't need to constantly monitor and manually update IP ranges for each service.

### If I'm using on-premises firewall, do I need to keep track of individual IP addresses?

You should use the [Service Tags with an on-premises firewall](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#service-tags-on-premises) so you don't need to monitor and manually update IP ranges. The [Service Tag Discovery API](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#use-the-service-tag-discovery-api) provides access to the latest IP address ranges associated with each service tag, enabling you to stay current with changes.
