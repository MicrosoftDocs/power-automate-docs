# IP address configuration

The [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform) from which Power Automate requests are sent depends on the [region](regions-overview.md) where the [environment](environments-overview-admin.md) that contains the flow is located. We don't currently publish FQDNs available for flow scenarios.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Some calls a cloud flow makes may come from IP addresses that are listed in the [Logic apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags) documentation. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + OpenAPI.

You should also consult the [Limits and Configuration](limits-and-config.md) article for a supplemental listing for known IP addresses that Power Automate uses.

>[!NOTE]
> Starting May 2022, Azure Logic Apps begins to enable availability zones in select regions for new Consumption logic apps. To support this capability, new IP addresses have been published for the Azure Logic Apps service and managed connectors. If you are restricting inbound or outbound IP addresses on your network (via a firewall, for example), to ensure flows continue to work after this date, update your network configuration to allow both the [IP addresses for Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-ip-configuration) and the [IP addresses for managed connectors](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses) in the supported regions. For more information, see [Azure Logic Apps - Set up zone redundancy with availability zones](/azure/logic-apps/set-up-zone-redundancy-availability-zones).

## Logic Apps

Calls made from a cloud flow go directly through the Azure Logic App service. Some examples of these calls include HTTP or HTTP + Open API. Refer to [the Logic apps documentation](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-limits-and-config#firewall-configuration-ip-addresses-and-service-tags) for which IP addresses are used by that service.

## Connectors

Calls made from a connector in a cloud flow (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from these [IP addresses](/connectors/common/outbound-ip-addresses#power-platform).

If you must authorize IP addresses for your Azure SQL database, you should use these addresses.

## Required services

The following table lists the services to which Power Automate connects. Ensure none of these services are blocked on your network.

## Desktop flows services required for runtime

The following table lists endpoint data requirements for connectivity from a user's machine for desktop flows runs. You need to ensure that you authorize Global endpoints and the endpoints corresponding to your cloud.

### Global endpoints

| Domains | Protocols | Uses |
| ------- |  -------- | ---- |
| server.events.data.microsoft.com|https|Handles telemetry for users outside EMEA, U.S. government, and Chinese clouds. Works as the fallback telemetry endpoint.|

> [!NOTE]
> If you donâ€™t want to allow the public endpoint **\*.servicebus.windows.net**, you can allow the list of namespaces individually. To find more information about namespace endpoints, go to [Allow list of namespaces endpoints required for runtime](limits-and-config.md#allow-list-of-namespaces-endpoints-required-for-runtime).
