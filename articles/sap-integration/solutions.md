# Understand prebuilt solution available for integrating SAP with Power Platform

Connecting your SAP system to Microsoft Power Platform extends its functionality and allows you to get more value out of your investment.

A prebuilt SAP integration solution is [available for download](https://github.com/jongilman88/PowerPlatformSAPIntegration). It incorporates Power Apps, Power Automate flows, and additional new functionalities that facilitate communication between your organization's SAP system with Power Platform.

The canvas app runs in your browser and streamlines SAP screens and data attributes onto one simple screen so users can easily view the data and complete tasks faster. Behind the scenes, Power Automate flows automate the business rules ensuring better data accuracy.

## What does the user interface look like?

On the surface, you see a canvas app that runs in your browser.

Here's the Purchase Orders template in the Purchasing module:

## How is it organized?

All of the screens and data attributes from SAP are streamlined onto one screen in the app.

Four key business processes in SAP ERP are organized into modules that contain accessible Power Apps templates. The templates enable users to perform standard workflow functions such as Search, Create, Change, or Display.

## What does the solution contain?

When you look the app behind the scenes, you see that the prebuilt solution is made up of sets of components that include:
