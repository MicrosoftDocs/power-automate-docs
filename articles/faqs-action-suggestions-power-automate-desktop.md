# FAQ for Power Automate for desktop suggested actions

## What is the suggested actions functionality

Suggested actions are a new AI capability that we added in Power Automate for desktop that allows you to quickly view suggestions on what your next action should be while designing your flow in the designer.

## What can the suggested actions do?  

Suggested actions can help you discover the next step of your automation by analyzing your flow and suggesting action candidates that you can include by selecting them.

## What is/are action suggestions intended use(s)?

The intended use of suggested actions is to allow users to quickly discover actions that can be used as the next building steps in their automation without searching the full list of actions in the designer.

## How can I use the suggested actions functionality?

You can access the new functionality by signing in with your work or school account in Power Automate for desktop and either creating a new flow or editing an existing one. When hovering over an action, select the plus icon, and the suggested actions panel opens.

## How was suggested actions evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We have a robust set of metrics we track to measure the performance of the model and resulting customer experience. We track the feature’s SLA to make sure it's always available to you. We track the telemetry of thumbs up and thumbs down gestures present in the UI experience for each AI output that you can submit feedback for.

You can provide feedback on this functionality when the results are biased or inappropriate. We track this feedback to ensure that AI feature is compliant, appropriate, and bias-free.

We meticulously tested the AI model through various internal processes and reviews in order to make sure that we provided the best possible quality and adhere to the highest of standards when it comes to security and reliability.

## What are the limitations of the suggested actions? How can the users minimize the impact of feature when using the system?

- The suggested actions Copilot capability is available to environments deployed in the following regions: Asia Pacific, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and United States.
- This capability is available only to users with a work or school account.
