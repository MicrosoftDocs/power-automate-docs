# Application lifecycle management in Process Mining overview

ALM (application lifecycle management) encompasses the entire lifecycle of applications, including governance, development, and maintenance. It incorporates various disciplines such as requirements management, software architecture, development, testing, maintenance, change management, support, continuous integration, project management, deployment, release management, and governance.

For an overview of ALM in Power Platform, go to [Overview of application lifecycle management with Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/alm/overview-alm).

With ALM, you can migrate all your process mining entities, including dataflow connections, custom metrics, Power BI reports, and more, from one environment to another&mdash;or in the case of Power BI reports, from one workspace to another. You can also rebind your Power BI reports with or without using a composite model. Another feature involves using Power BI pipelines for moving entities across two different workspaces.

To learn more about these ALM features, select from the following list:

- [Migrate Process Mining entities with Power Platform solutions](process-mining-alm-entities-solutions.md)
- [Migrate customized Process Mining Power BI reports](process-mining-pbi-reports-overview.md)
- [Migrate using Power BI pipelines and rebinding](process-mining-alm-migrate-using-pbi-pipelines-and-rebinding.md)
