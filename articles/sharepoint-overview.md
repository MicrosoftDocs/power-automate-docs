# Use SharePoint and Power Automate to build workflows.

Power Automate is deeply integrated with Microsoft SharePoint. This document outlines some of the key scenarios in which you can use Power Automate to build flows. You can start with any of the more than [100 SharePoint templates](https://flow.microsoft.com/templates/) or create your own flow that integrates with SharePoint from scratch.

## Top SharePoint workflow scenarios

Here are some of the top scenarios in which you can use Power Automate with SharePoint:

- Route finished documents to a [team for approval](./customize-sharepoint-page-approvals).
- Create [SharePoint reminder flows](create-sharepoint-reminder-flows.md).
- Create a [flow for a list or library in SharePoint or OneDrive.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-flow-for-a-list-or-library-in-sharepoint-or-onedrive-a9c3e03b-0654-46af-a254-20252e580d01)
- [Edit a flow for a list in SharePoint.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/edit-a-flow-for-a-list-in-sharepoint-b6678daa-2c82-44eb-be3f-2a9cb56301e8)
- Create a record in Microsoft Dynamics CRM when a list item gets added to a SharePoint list. More Info:
- Copy new members from MailChimp lists to SharePoint lists.
- Move files to different folders after they’re approved in SharePoint.
- Create an item in SharePoint when a new order is added in Salesforce.


## SharePoint triggers and actions

Here is a partial list of the triggers you can use to start flows.

Once your flow starts, you can use any of the more than 40 *actions* to manipulate your SharePoint list members:

Whether you start with a SharePoint template or begin from scratch, using Power Automate to create automation features is intuitive.
