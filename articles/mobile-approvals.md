# Approve requests on your mobile device by using Power Automate

If a cloud flow identifies you as an approver and you've installed the mobile app for Power Automate, you receive a push notification whenever your approval is requested.

This article walks you through a few common scenarios that youâ€™re likely to encounter while you manage approval requests in the mobile app for Power Automate.

## Prerequisites
To complete this walkthrough, you need:

* An [Android](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsandroid) or [iOS](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsios) device running the mobile app for Power Automate.
* To be designated as the approver in an approval flow.
* Pending requests for approval.

## View pending requests
1. Open the mobile app for Power Automate.
   
    ![start the mobile app.](./media/mobile-approvals/launch_power_automate.png)
2. Select **APPROVALS** in the bottom-right corner and you will see a list of pending approvals if any exist.
   
    ![select approvals.](./media/mobile-approvals/select_approvals.jpg)

If you don't have any pending approval requests and you would like to test the functionality, create an [approval flow](modern-approvals.md), set yourself as an approver, and then trigger the flow. Approval requests appear in the approval center a few seconds after the flow triggers and sends a request for approval.

## Approve or reject requests and leave an optional message
1. Navigate to the **add a message along with your reply** to input a custom message if required, then select **APPROVE**, or **REJECT** on the request.

2. A notification stating **approval submitted successfully** will appear once the process is completed.
