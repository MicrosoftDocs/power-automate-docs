The right to erasure allows data subjects to request the removal of their personal data, including system-generated logs but not audit logs, from an organization's customer data. When a user decides to close their Microsoft account, their underlying data is also deleted.

The following personal data is automatically deleted when a user closes their Microsoft account:

- Product and service activity
- Run history
- Flows
- Activity Feed
- User details
- Connections
