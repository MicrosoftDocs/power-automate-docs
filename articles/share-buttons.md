# Share button flows in Power Automate

In the Power Automate mobile app, you can share [button flows](introduction-to-button-flows.md) (buttons) with other users or groups within your organization. When you share a button, the person or group with whom you share can run your button, the same way they run their own buttons. You can also [share a link](share-buttons.md#re-share-a-button) to buttons that another person shared with you. You can [stop sharing](share-buttons.md#stop-sharing-a-button) your buttons at any time.

Follow [these steps](share-buttons.md#use-shared-buttons) to use a button that someone shared with you.

## Prerequisites
To share buttons, you need:

* An account with access to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com).
* A flow to share.
* A mobile device with the Power Automate mobile app for [Android](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsandroid), [iOS](https://aka.ms/flowmobiledocsios), or [Windows Phone](https://aka.ms/flowmobilewindows).
* A group or user within your organization with whom to share your button.

## Share a button
You can share a button from the **Buttons** tab of the Power Automate mobile app.

## Require users to use their own connections
> [!NOTE]
> When you share a button, you can allow persons with whom you've shared the button to use all connections that your button uses. You can also require them to use their own connections. If you allow others to use your connections, they can't access the credentials in your connection, or reuse them in any other flow.
> 
> 

Follow these steps to require persons with whom you've shared your buttons to use their own connections.

1. Select **MANAGE CONNECTIONS** on the screen that's displayed immediately after you share a button.
2. Select **EDIT** on the button you want to manage.
3. Select **Provided by user** or your email address.
   
    Your choice indicates whose connections must be used in the shared button.
   
    ![share button.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-select-connection-provided-by-user.png)
   
    You can view or change your choice any time. To do so, select the **Flows** tab > the flow you shared > **Users and connections** > the **CONNECTIONS** tab > **EDIT** on the button you want to manage.
   
    ![share button.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-conn-provided-by-user.png)

## View the list of button users
You can view all groups or users with whom a button is shared by following these steps from the **Buttons** tab:

1. Tap the small icon next to the button in which you're interested.
2. On the **Button users** page, view all groups or users with whom the button is shared.
   
    ![view button users.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-button-users-list.png)

## Stop sharing a button
You can stop sharing a button by following these steps from the **Buttons** tab:

1. Tap the small icon next to the button you no longer want to share.
2. On the **Button users** page, tap the user or group with whom you want to stop sharing the button.
   
    ![stop sharing button.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-remove-user-list.png)
3. Tap **Remove user** when the user's page is displayed.
   
    ![stop sharing button.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-remove-user.png)
4. Wait for the remove operation to complete. Notice the **Button users** list refreshes, and the user or group you removed is no longer listed.

## Monitor the run history
All run history, including the runs initiated by a person with whom a button is shared, appear only on the **Activity** tab of the button creator's Power Automate mobile app.

## Use shared buttons
Before you can run a button that someone has shared with you, you must add it to your **Buttons** tab from the **Add buttons** page.

1. Tap **GET MORE** (or the **New buttons are available** banner if it appears) on the **Buttons** tab.
   
    ![new button shared with me.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-banner.png)
2. Tap the button you want to use.
   
    The tapped button is immediately added to the **Buttons** tab of the Power Automate app. You can then use the button from the **Buttons** tab, just like any other button that's listed there.
   
    ![new button shared with me.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-buttons-shared-with-me.png)

## Re-share a button
You can share a link to a button that's been shared with you.

1. Select **...** next to the button you want to share.
2. Select **Share button link**.
   
    ![re-share button link.](./media/share-buttons/re-share-button.png)
3. Select the app that you'd like to use to share the button, and then follow the steps to send the button to the person with whom you want to share.

## Stop using a shared button
If you no longer want to use a button that was shared with you, remove it from the **Buttons** tab by taking these steps:

1. On the **Buttons** tab, tap **...** next to the button you no longer want to use.
   
    ![remove button.](./media/share-buttons/share-button-flows-added-shared-button.png)
2. Tap **Remove** from the menu that appears.

That's it. The button no longer appears on the **Buttons** tab of the Power Automate app.
