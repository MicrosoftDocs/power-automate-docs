# Respond to GDPR Data Subject Discovery Requests 


The first step in responding to a DSR request is to find the personal data that’s the subject of the request.
Here’s a summary of the Power Automate resources that contain personal data for a user who authenticates with their Microsoft Account (MSA).

|Resource|Purpose|
|-----|-----|
|Run history|Provides the history of each flow’s execution for the past 28 days. This data includes start time, end time, status, and all input/output information for each flow run. Learn more about [flow run history](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/download-history-recurrence/).|
|Activity feed| Provides a recap of each flow’s activities, including run status, failures, and notifications.|
|Flows|The workflow logic for a [flow](./get-started-logic-flow.md).|
|Connections|Used by connectors and allow connectivity to APIs, systems, databases, and more. Learn more about [connections](add-manage-connections.md).|
